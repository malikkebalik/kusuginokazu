Perry reportedly paid $20 million for the penthouse in 2017, sinking an untold amount of additional money into an extensive renovation over the last couple of years. It measures 9,290 square feet with room for four bedrooms and eight bathrooms, as well as a generous four outdoor terraces, a private screening room, and a fireplace and lounge inside the master suite.</p><p>And of course, The Century has plenty of luxury amenities of its own that you would expect from the location of the most expensive condo in LA, like a pool and spa, a gym, a restaurant, its own screening room, and a reported four acres of gardens.</p><p>It's a stunning luxury penthouse that might even put Chandler Bing's improbably spacious Manhattan digs to shame. As the official listing describes it:</p><p><strong>"Hovering above the city like a floating palace is Penthouse 40, the "Mansion in the Sky" that occupies the entire 40th floor of the exclusive Century building. The sprawling interior has been transformed by architect Scott Joyce and noted interior designer LM Pagano into a stunning palette of textures & colors that are both contemporary & classic, comprising a bold statement worthy of the most discerning buyer."</strong></p><p>Whether or not you intend to be that most discerning buyer, you can take a close look at the Matthew Perry penthouse in the video below, courtesy of the property's official listing with Holcomb Petersen:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGedlsG1tMSwZKmdoqfGbrjIrKusZZyWerGxza2fqK2jmnqnu9Fmam5lnZ65rbXOp2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
