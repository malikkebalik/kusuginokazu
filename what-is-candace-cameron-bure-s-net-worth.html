Fans may know her as DJ Tanner from&nbsp;Full House.&nbsp;Or maybe they know her as a self help guru. She has made a name for herself in a few different disciplines.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_31>She got her start working on sitcoms like&nbsp;Full House,&nbsp;but she also has a successful publishing career, and has written a few self-help books. Recently, she’s been appearing on the Hallmark channel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Candace-Cameron.jpg><h2>Her marriage is #RelationshipGoals</h2><p id=par-3_52>Cameron Bure and her husband have been together for <a href=#>more than 20 years</a> now. They are both successful in their own fields. That success has contributed to the net worth they’ve built together. During the height of Valerie Bure’s career, he was making more than $20 million a season with the NHL.</p><p id=par-4_35>Cameron Bure and her husband are both religious people, and Cameron Bure says that Jesus helps keep her marriage going strong after 20 years together. The couple turns to the Bible for help resolving disputes.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_40>Bure is originally from Russia. He and Cameron Bure have three children together. Their youngest is 17. These two are dedicated parents. However, they haven’t been caught up in legal trouble over their children like some of Cameron Bure’s co-stars.&nbsp;</p><h2>Cameron Bure had help on her way to fame</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-6_24>Cameron Bure definitely has talent in her own right. However, she had a leg up when it came to breaking into the entertainment industry.</p><p id=par-7_39>Her brother is Kirk Cameron, who got his start before Cameron Bure. The&nbsp;Full House&nbsp;star’s older brother got his big break on the show&nbsp;Growing Pains.&nbsp;Cameron Bure appeared in a guest spot alongside her big bro before being cast in&nbsp;Full House.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_24>From there, she landed small roles in&nbsp;Punky Brewster&nbsp;and&nbsp;St. Elsewhere.&nbsp;Once&nbsp;Full House&nbsp;started with Cameron Bure as DJ, the show would take up much of her childhood.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_42>Being a child star gave Cameron Bure a lot of life experience at a young age. She had to mature faster than other kids, and she tries to transmit the tips and tricks she learned to her fans through her self-help books.</p><p id=par-10_45>All her books have been relatively successful, although only the first made it onto the New York Times Bestseller list. Now, she has an <a href=#>eight-book deal</a> with a Christian publishing company. We can expect to see a lot more from Cameron Bure in the future.&nbsp;</p><h2>Candace Cameron Bure is worth a surprising amount&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-11_44>All those Hallmark movies add up, but Cameron Bure is still worth more than you may expect. In her 43 years, she’s had a lot of time to amass wealth, and her net worth is competitive. She’s worth almost as much as bigger stars.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_29>Cameron Bure has a net worth of around $14 million, according to the site <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Her time on&nbsp;Full House and subsequent return to&nbsp;Fuller House&nbsp;definitely contributed to that.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_48>The original show aired between 1987 and 1995, but the reboot just wrapped its fifth and final season this year. Cameron Bure was emotional at the thought of leaving the show that shaped her career. All in all, she has played DJ Tanner for more than 13 years.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_42>She’s best known for her role as DJ, but that’s not all she’s done. After the original&nbsp;Full House&nbsp;went off the air in 1995, Cameron Bure started in publishing. She’s written three books, all about how to balance spirituality, life, and physical fitness.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_34>It’s an impressive resume, but her own work isn’t the only reason for her high net worth. Her husband, Valerie Bure, is a former professional hockey player. The $14 million is their combined wealth.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZqCsZZOWu6Wtwp5knJmdmr%2BwuoybrKudo2K7psCMsKarrJhjtbW5y2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
