She now eighty-four seconds away. She tends to take that as an open invitation to come by Deeks’s home whenever she wishes and lately she’s been trying to turn the whole family vegan. Roberta was vegan. She now thinks the whole family should be vegan too. She shows up with vegan donuts and Rosa couldn’t eat it because she was sick. Rosa had the flu. It’s been going around at her high school. Deeks found out when he called to excuse Rosa from school and he wanted to do more, but he got called into work. Deeks left Rosa in the care of his mother. And then he went into work.</p><p>He and the others were brought in to investigate the impeding death of Marine Private First Class Edward Hanson. Hanson suffered a massive seizure during a friendly match against his fellow officer. He wasn’t hit in the head or anything like that. He’s also never had a history of seizures. He went from not having any to suddenly have his organs shut down on while he’s in a coma. Hanson’s illness was brought on too quickly. Too unnaturally to be dismissed. It was investigated and the doctors believe they found something. They believe his impending death was first attack using a genetic weapon. The Department of the Defense brought in NCIS to investigate. They wanted them to start at the army base where Hanson had the seizure.</p><p>Hanson has been struggling since joining the military. He wasn’t fast, he wasn’t strong, and he sure wasn’t smart. Him winning that friendly bout was the first sign of improvement since he joined up. Then he quickly had that seizure. His training officer had thought he pushed Hanson too hard. But NCIS later came around. They had everyone in contact with Hanson to do a blood test. The only one they couldn’t reach was Hanson best friend as well as roommate, PFC James Williams. Williams was missing. The team tried to find him. They were able to figure out where he was going. Williams was going to LA.</p><p>Williams recently opened a joint cryptocurrency account with Hanson. They haven’t been collecting money. They’ve been giving it away. They were paying some guy named Xander Yost thousands of dollars. Deeks and Roundtree went to the Yost’s house. They quickly found Williams. Williams said he didn’t kill him. Roundtree said Hanson wasn’t dead, but that wasn’t who Williams was talking about. Williams was talking about Yost. Yost was dead. He was killed and stuffed in a freezer. Williams was claiming he found Yost that way. Yost was a former med student whose specialty was gene therapy. And that’s why both Hanson and Williams turned to him.</p><p>They were the bottom of their group. They thought gene therapy would help them with strength and speed. Which was happened the first few times they were taking their orders. But something changed when Hanson had his seizure. Williams tried to get in touch with Yost. Yost wasn’t answering him. This is what compelled Williams to seek out Yost. He found him dead and the lab was missing. It was no longer at Yost’s place. It was all gone. Williams thought Yost’s assistant might know what’s going on. He gave them the assistant’s information. They traced him back to a crowd-funded lab.</p><p>Fatima pretended to be someone interested in joining. She wore a wire and she pretended to be someone else, but her cover was blown because one guy had a frequency transmitter attached to his skull and he was able to put together that Fatima was wearing a wire. That she was a fed. He then announced it to everyone. Only Fatima was quick on her feet. She pretended her wire was just something she wears to help with her condition. Her quick thinking got everyone to back down and she got to see more of Opensource Bio. She found out that Yost’s assistant was Nicholas Embry. And that he was no longer at Opensource because he demanded to use CRSPR. And they told him no.</p><p>But before he left, he stole several pieces of equipment. Embry did the same with Yost. It turns out Embry wanted to kill as much as he could using Yost’s gene therapy. He killed Yost when the other man found out what he was doing and tried to stop him. Embry wanted to eliminate everyone that has a genetic defect. Embry himself was diabetic. He was also suicidal. He felt he was never meant to live and so he wanted to contaminate insulin to kill off the other people he felt were “defective”. The team caught up with him and they were able to take him down before he hurt anyone else. And the team were still talking about it when Callen realized he lost his nephew’s pet snake at the warehouse.</p><p>The snake was named Houdini because he liked to escape his cage.</p><p>And Deeks returned home after a day of worrying for Rosa. It had even affected work and the Admiral took him task before he was told about Rosa’s condition. Admiral Killbride went on to apologize once he knew the truth. He said all fathers worry about their children. And he knew tht there was nothing Deeks wanted more than to be with his daughter when she was sick.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWtnnpi2tHnLqKpmmZ6csq2x0mapnpuRpXpyfYxrZ2ZqYmLApq3SqKVmaWRisrG10qibnmVnYsC2vtWirZqkXaSzbsDHnmSfoaSpsrTAjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
