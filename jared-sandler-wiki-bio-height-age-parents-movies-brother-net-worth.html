Happy Madison’s first animated picture, “Eighty Crazy Nights,” would be Jared’s next endeavor, as well as his uncle’s first voice-acting job. Due to its modern-day portrayal of Christmas and Hanukkah, which are widely observed in Jewish culture, the film has a cult following, particularly among Jews. He also pursued acting opportunities outside of his uncle’s firm, the first of which was a role on Showtime’s “Shameless.”</p><p>He struggled at first, as do many comedians because he wasn’t used to performing in front of an audience, but he finally developed his routine and began performing regularly.

He had a brief appearance in “Pixels” the next year, which also included other Adam Sandler family members.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibiography.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jared-Sandler-43534123-300x227.jpg.webp alt width=735 height=556 sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jared_Sandler_Family_Parents_and_Siblings></span>Jared Sandler Family: Parents and Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jared was born to his parents Scott Sandler and Denise Cohen Sandler.
