Though she wasn’t the first letter turner –that honor goes to&nbsp;woman named Susan Stafford, White’s stunning outfits and ageless grace have delighted generations of folks who have turn on the show each weekday to watch it from their living rooms– and others who have actually been able to compete on the show and see White and c0-host Pat Sajak up close and personal.</p><p id=par-2_67><a href=#>Though White has been a staple on the series for 30 years</a> –first turning letters and then lightly touching the massive game board once it became computerized in 1997, it looks like she hasn’t aged since she first was first picked as the permanent&nbsp;hostess on&nbsp;December 13, 1982. So how old is Vanna White and what is her net worth after more than 30 years in show business?</p><h2>Vanna White is 61 years old</h2><p id=par-4_55>We know it’s impolite to tell a lady’s age, but we would be ecstatic to look like Ms. White in our sixties. The former actress and South Carolina native was born on&nbsp;February 18, 1957. Though she was born Vanna Marie Rosich — she took the name of her stepfather&nbsp;Herbert Stackley White Jr. who raised her.</p><p id=par-5_104>Over the years, White has taken special care of her appearance, and she’s worn nearly 7,000 outfits on Wheel of Fortune — never wearing the same outfit twice. Though she doesn’t get to keep her dresses, <a href=#>in a 2016 interview with Fox News</a> — White explained that each week she tries on&nbsp;tries on 50 to 60 dresses and chooses her favorites. She revealed, “My favorite dresses happen to be the comfortable ones. They have to go back to the designer, but I certainly enjoy wearing them. I’ve gone through all the big styles, [including] the big shoulder pads. You name it; I’ve done it.”</p><p id=par-6_1>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HahALvfKLVk</p><h2>Vanna White is worth $50 million</h2><p id=par-7_79>It truly pays to be a game show host, and there is much more to White’s job then simply touching letters. She and Pat Sajak have helped come up with many&nbsp;puzzles over the years. <a href=#>Wheel of Fortune</a> executive producer&nbsp;<a href=#>Harry Friedman explained that it’s all</a>, “very scientific.” He added that&nbsp; everyone contributes to the “group effort.” For her efforts, White is paid a $10 million salary for Wheel of Fortune which has greatly contributed to her $50 million net worth.</p><p id=par-8_55>While it looks like she and Sajak have hardly anytime off, you should know that the Wheel of Fortune hosts tape a week’s worth of episodes in just one day. An avid fan of&nbsp;crochet and knitting– White also has her own brand of yarn, “Vanna’s Choice” through Lion Brand Yarns and a best-selling autobiography&nbsp;1987’s&nbsp;Vanna Speaks!</p><p id=par-10_42>Throughout the&nbsp;years, White has guest starred on various TV shows including&nbsp;L.A. Law,&nbsp;227,&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Queens, and&nbsp;Full House. She’s also lent her voice to the animated shows and specials&nbsp;—The Real Story of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star&nbsp;and the TV series&nbsp;Captain Planet and the Planeteers.</p><p id=par-11_13>Currently, White has signed on to remain on Wheel of Fortune until 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1sMOMqKOdZZmoeri0xJ6jZqeWYrOwvtOupZ5lmKTAtXnVmqWnmV2starAxGaYp5xdrLWiwIyiqmaglad6r7HTZq6oqqSde6nAzKVm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
