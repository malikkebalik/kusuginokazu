Born November 20, 1954 in Pasadena, California, Steve Dahl is one of Chicago's most outrageous radio personalities and has also proven to be equally successful as a vocalist and songwriter. His band, Teenage Radiation, used a sharp sense of humor to turn such parodies as RTA and Do You Think I'm Disco into national hits. Do You Think I'm Disco reached the top position on a novelty records top ten, compiled by Dr. Demento in August 1979. Dahl later collaborated with <a href=# title="Brian Wilson Net Worth">Brian Wilson</a> and producer/keyboard player <a href=# title="Joe Thomas Net Worth">Joe Thomas</a> to write the title song of Wilson's 1998 album, Imagination. Dahl moved to Chicago in the mid-'70s to host the morning shift on WLUP. Dahl found a similar-minded collaborator when he met overnight DJ Garry Meier in 1978. Dahl and Meier formed one of the most controversial duos in broadcasting.</p><p>One of their first stunts was a Disco Demolition night at Comiskey Park in 1979. In 1981, they were fired for violating community language standards and moved on to take over the afternoon shift at WLS-FM. Despite the change, Dahl and Meier continued to face opposition. When transferred to WLS-AM in 1984, the duo missed numerous shows and it took legal litigation and suspension before they agreed to finish out their contract. They returned to WLUP-FM in 1986. Although he remained active in radio, Dahl experienced a low point in his career during the '90s, but following a brief stint on a sports radio station, he bounced back as host of a popular radio talk show since 1996. Steve Dahl and Teenage Radiation performed their final concert on June 8, 1997.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70q2cr51dma6puIynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
