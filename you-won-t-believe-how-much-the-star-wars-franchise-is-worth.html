New estimates report the Star Wars movie franchise is worth more than the combined franchises of Harry Potter and James Bond, at an astounding&nbsp;<strong>$42 billion</strong>.</p><p>Most experts and Star Wars fans expected the newest film in the series to have huge box office numbers and it certainly has not disappointed, taking in over $1 billion in its first 10 days. That kind of success is nothing new to the Star Wars series, which has been a money maker since 1977.</p><p>Speaking of success at the box office, the total worldwide gross for all seven of the original Star Wars movies, three special edition re-releases, re-issues of the first two films, and the animated movie Star Wars: The Clone Wars have brought in more than $5 billion combined. In fact, Fortune magazine has estimated that just the seven "normal" Star Wars movies alone have brought in about $7.3 billion, when adjusted for inflation.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-180976 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/GettyImages-501661442.jpg alt="Getty Images" width=900 height=606 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-180976 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><p>Star Wars makes tons of money at the box office, but even after it leaves theaters, it continues to be a money maker. The franchise has made an estimated $5.3 billion through DVD and digital sales and rentals (and old-school VHS back in the day).&nbsp;The Force Awakens is estimated to bring in about $458 million from those watching at home in its first year alone, which will bring the total up to $5.7 billion.</p><p>Kids love Star Wars and their parents know that all too well. Since 1977, the film franchise has made an estimated <strong>$12 billion</strong> in toy sales alone, and The Force Awakens is projected to add another $5 billion to that total.</p><p>Both children and adults like to play video games, and so far there are just about 100 Star Wars video game titles that have managed to earn around $3 billion in sales. The two newest releases Star Wars: Battlefront and Disney Infinity 3.0 are estimated to make $1.3 billion, which will bring the total video game revenue for Star Wars up to about $4.3 billion.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-180977 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/GettyImages-494861904.jpg alt="FREDERIC J.

BROWN/AFP/Getty Images</p><p>Don't forget to take the intellectual property into account; Disney spent $4 billion acquiring the franchise and Lucasfilm in 2012. You also have to include Star Wars books at $1.8 billion, The Clone Wars animated television series at $4.5 million, licensing fees at $825 million, and the resale market for Star Wars collectibles at $1 billion.</p><p>If you carry the 1, all of that adds up to right around $42 billion, making Star Wars the most expensive movie franchise of all time. Next on that list is Harry Potter at $25 billion, followed by James Bond at $8 billion, and Twilight and Lord of the Rings at $6 billion each. In fact, the Star Wars movie franchise is worth more than the GDPs of both Jordan (at $35.8 billion) and Paraguay (at $30.9 billion). At this rate, perhaps Star Wars will soon have its own country.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJoqq2ZomLEor7SZp2rmZ6Ytaq%2FxGauqKqknXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
