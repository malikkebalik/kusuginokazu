He currently resides in Forest, Virginia. Ott was formerly the pitching coach with the New Jersey Jackals of the Canadian-American Association of Professional Baseball.</p><p>Ott later became a coach with the Houston Astros, serving under manager and former Pirates teammate Art Howe, from 1989 to 1993, where he is remembered for his role in an on-field altercation against the Cincinnati Reds. In 1991, Reds reliever <a href=#>Rob Dibble</a> (part of the Reds Nasty Boys bullpen) ignited a brawl when he threw a pitch behind the back of the Astros' <a href=#>Eric Yelding</a>, late in the game of a 4–1 Reds loss. A melee ensued and the 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m), 230 lb (100 kg), Dibble wound up on the bottom of a pile with the relatively diminutive Ott having put Dibble in such a choke hold that Dibble's face turned blue. Ott later coached for the Detroit Tigers (2001–2002).</p><p>With young catcher Tony Peña ready to take over the catching duties, the Pirates traded Ott to the California Angels in April 1981. Ott had a down year in 1981 batting just .217. Ott tore his rotator cuff and underwent surgery, causing him to miss the entire 1982 season. He appeared briefly as a first baseman in the Angels minor-league organization in 1983 and 1984 before retiring as a player at the age of 32.</p><p>Ott platooned with catcher <a href=#>Steve Nicosia</a> in 1979, and had his best season with a .273 batting average along with 7 home runs, 51 runs batted in and a career-high .994 fielding percentage, second only to <a href=#>Gene Tenace</a> among National League catchers. Led by future Hall of Fame inductee, <a href=#>Willie Stargell</a>, the 1979 Pirates won the National League Eastern Division pennant, then defeated the Cincinnati Reds in the 1979 National League Championship Series, before winning the 1979 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles. During the seven-game series, Ott posted a .333 batting average along with 3 runs batted in.</p><p>Ott appeared in 112 games for the Pirates in 1978 as, the team battled from being 11.5 games behind on August 25 to finish the season 1.5 games behind the Philadelphia Phillies. He won the National League Player of the Week Award for the week of September 3rd and, his batting average improved to .269.</p><p>Known as a tough, no-nonsense player, Ott was a former wrestler who was not afraid to use those skills on a baseball diamond. In an August 12, 1977, game against the New York Mets, Ott slid hard into Mets' second baseman Felix Millán trying to break up a double play. Millán shouted at Ott and hit him with a baseball in his hand. Ott answered this by picking Milan up, upending him, and then slamming him into his extended knee at Three Rivers Stadium, severely injuring his shoulder. The incident effectively ended Milan's MLB career.</p><p>Ott made the Pirates major league roster as third-string catcher in 1976, backing up Manny Sanguillén and <a href=#>Duffy Dyer</a>. The Pirates traded Sanguillen to the Oakland Athletics before the 1977 season, and new Pirates manager <a href=#>Chuck Tanner</a> installed Ott into a platoon role alongside Dyer. He played in 104 games that year while hitting for a .264 batting average.</p><p>Ott began his professional baseball career in 1970 with the Niagara Falls Pirates of the New York-Pennsylvania League where his manager converted him into an outfielder. The next season, he posted a .292 batting average while playing for the Monroe Pirates then hit .304 for the Salem Pirates in 1972. His performance earned him a promotion to the Triple-A Charleston Charlies in 1973. He was briefly promoted to the major leagues, making his debut with the Pittsburg Pirates on June 10, 1974 at the age of 22 before returning to play for Charleston.</p><p>Ott was born in Muncy, Pennsylvania where he attended Muncy High School. He is not related to Baseball Hall of Fame member Mel Ott. Although Muncy High School did not have a baseball team, Ott excelled at football and wrestling. He played in American Legion Baseball where he became a standout third baseman. He was drafted out of Muncy High School by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 23rd round of the 1970 Major League Baseball draft.</p><p>Nathan Edward Ott (born July 11, 1951), is an American former professional baseball player, coach and manager.
