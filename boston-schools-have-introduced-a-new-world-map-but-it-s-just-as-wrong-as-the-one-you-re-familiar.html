You probably saw it hanging in your Geography classroom, and it may be how you imagine the Earth to look.</p><p>However, it has been heavily criticised because it exaggerates the size of imperialist powers like Europe and North America, and shrinks South America and Africa.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>The Mercator map. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText><a href=# rel=nofollow class="image-source-link not-content-link" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>Strebe / Wikimedia Commons</a></span></span></figure><p>The Boston authorities thought in an era of "alternative facts," a shift in the map style was called for, to "decolonize the curriculum" in public schools, and more accurately depict the sizes of countries. Greenland, for example, is actually a lot smaller than the Mercator shows, and South America is really twice the size of Europe.</p><p>However, while some see the change as a victory against "fake news," not everyone is thrilled with the decision. The Gall-Peters map shows the correct sizes of countries, but it also distorts them. Countries are stretched horizontally near the poles and vertically near the Equator, so although the size may be right, the shape definitely isn't.</p><p>The problem is, it's impossible to stretch the 3D sphere shape of the Earth onto a 2D sheet of paper. No matter which way it's done, there will always be a compromise somewhere on shape, size, direction, distance or scale.</p><p>If the widespread use of the Mercator was a sign of bias, finding an alternative is a good idea. But the choice of Gall-Peters has upset map enthusiasts, who argue there are many other map types to choose from which aren't so ugly.</p>—Kenneth Field (@kennethfield) <a href=# rel=nofollow>March 20, 2017</a><p>Here are four alternatives to the Mercator and Gall-Peters maps:</p><h2>The Winkel tripel projection (Winkel III)</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-only><span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Wikimedia Commons</span></span></figure><p>National Geographic adopted the Winkel tripel map in 1998, and it was designed in 1921 by Oswald Winkel with the intention of minimising three area, direction, and distance distortion.</p><h2>The Kavrayskiy VII projection</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-only><span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText><a href=# rel=nofollow class="image-source-link not-content-link" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>Strebe / Wikimedia Commons</a></span></span></figure><p>The Kavrayskiy map was designed by Vladimir V. Kavrayskiy in 1939, and scores well as a projection with little distortion. However, it isn't used much outside the former Soviet Union.</p><h2>The Hobo-Dyer projection</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-only><span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText><a href=# rel=nofollow class="image-source-link not-content-link" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>Strebe / Wikimedia Commons</a></span></span></figure><p>There is no north-south or east-west distortion on the Hobo-Dyer map. It's often used as an alternative to the Gall-Peters projection because it's more visually satisfying. The map stretches the low latitudes less than Gall-Peters, but the poles are more distorted as a result.</p><h2>The Waterman</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-only><span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText><a href=# rel=nofollow class="image-source-link not-content-link" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>Steve Waterman / Wikimedia Commons</a></span></span></figure><p>The Waterman — or "Butterfly" — world map was designed by Steve Waterman in 1996. It shows how the Earth would look if it were unfolded <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>from a truncated octahedron</a>. It was <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>based on the Cahill projection</a> designed in 1909 by cartographer and architect Bernard J. S. Cahill.</p><p>There are many other versions of the map of Earth, and they all have their advantages and drawbacks. But there's one thing almost everyone seems to agree on — you can't beat a globe.</p>—Jacob Richardson (@jacobrichardson) <a href=# rel=nofollow>March 20, 2017</a> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png alt="A picture of a switch and lightbulb" itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Sign up for notifications from Insider!
