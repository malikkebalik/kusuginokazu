The youngest ever musician to win all four general categories at the Oscars, and unsurprisingly almost everything she does becomes news.
Recommended Videos Her recent dating history has been particularly noteworthy, as her personal life got very public after she began dating Jesse Rutherford. Perhaps not on the same level of famous, many are still being clued onto who Rutherford is. <a href=../../../who-is-jesse-rutherford-where-you-know-billie-eilish-s-new-boyfriend-from.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../why-john-diehl-s-larry-zito-character-got-killed-off.html>Why John Diehl's Larry Zito Character Got Killed Off</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

The one big change came early, when Lt. Lou Rodriguez (Gregory Sierra) died by an assassin’s bullet in “Calderon’s Return: Part I.” From that point on, Edward James Olmos took charge of the vice squad as Lt. Castillo.

Obviously he’ll get a lot of those offers as a charming, handsome and charismatic guy, but it would be generous to call the likes of S.W.A.T., The Recruit and the Total Recall remake bland as hell. <a href=../../../a-forgotten-colin-farrell-thriller-is-blowing-up-on-netflix.html>Read More...</a></section></article></main><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=../../../post/page/62/index.html>&lt; Prev</a>
