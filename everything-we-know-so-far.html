He is a normal 18-year-old high school student. So Mun’s parents died in a car accident seven years ago. He was left in the care of his grandparents.</p><p id=par-3_52>One day he learns the reality of the world and the Counters. The Counters are supernaturally enhanced fighters who track down rogue demons. They send them back where they belong. When the Counters fight a high-level demon, one of them is killed, and their spirit finds its way to So Mun.</p><p id=par-4_40>So Mun is an exception to the rules the Counters have never seen before. A Counter can only be made when the selected is in a coma. So Mun was not and shows supernatural abilities no Counter has had before.</p><p id=par-5_33>As a powerful demon threatens humanity, the Counters and So Mon take action and break the rules. They realize the demon has a connection to So Mun’s past and the other Counters.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Plans for ‘The Uncanny Counter’ Season 2 were confirmed in 2021</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_40>The Netflix K-drama quickly became one of the top watched dramas on Netflix and OCN. The 16-episode K-drama finished its run on Jan. 24, 2021. Before the finale, fans were already clamoring for a new season, and OCN obliged.</p><p id=par-7_46>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Soompi</a>, the new season was confirmed by OCN on Jan.24, 2021. “It is true that a second season has been confirmed for ‘The Uncanny Counter,'” said OCN. But details about the filming locations, main cast, and overall storyline are still in the dark.</p><p id=par-8_34>It has been almost a year since the initial news about The Uncanny Counter Season 2. But there has been no official announcement by OCN or Netflix of an official filming start date.</p><p id=par-9_70>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">South China Morning Post</a>, back in 2021, “Reports suggest that talks are underway and the show may be aiming to get the cast back in front of cameras around September, with the new episodes airing early next year.” Well into 2022, fans have yet to see anything about the K-drama or its official main cast. Fans will have to continue to wait for any morsel of information.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who will star in the new season of the K-drama?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_61>The Uncanny Counter ended on a good note with So Mun saying his farewell to his parents’ spirits. After the season’s turmoil, the council decides not to reprimand the Counters. The K-drama ends with the main character getting new outfits to fight demons in. The finale left the door open for more storylines and the return of the leading cast.</p><p id=par-11_62>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Soompi</a>, Kim Se-jeong, who played Do Ha-na, explained, “However, if it becomes a reality, I think that all of the actors [from Season 1] will probably want to return for it. Because everyone in the cast and crew was really great, as long as we’re able to keep going with this team, I think everyone will want to take part.”</p><p id=par-12_65>The leading cast has not actively worked on The Uncanny Counter Season 2 as Kim now <a href=#>stars in Netflix’s Business Proposal</a>. Actor Yoo Jun-sang&nbsp;has also appeared in new dramas and Yeom Hye-ran. Leading actor Jo Byung-gyu was excited to learn of a season two but explains, “I also learned through the news, and I only heard that they were in the midst of fine-tuning.”</p><p id=par-13_58>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Soompi</a>, he is also in the dark, saying, “I haven’t yet heard anything about the broadcast or time frame.” The Uncanny Counter was Jo’s last K-drama before facing a bullying accusation in February 2021. If one thing is for certain, fans can expect the main cast to be willing to return for a new season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMrqWcmZ6jxm6vzq6lrZ2iYsCmrdKopWZqXZrDpr7YrZ%2BippdixKZ5yqemsGWjpHqnrdFnn62lnGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
