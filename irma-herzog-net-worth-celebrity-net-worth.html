Herzog and her husband own the popular Driver's Seat Restaurant in South Hampton, New York along with a 600-foot gallery space across the street. She is a hands-on owner and seems to know every customer by name. The rest of her staff is equally attentive and the restaurant is known as one of the friendliest bars in the East End. Prior to becoming a restaurant in 1960, the location was a produce store. Once it became a restaurant, it was called Driver's Seat Restaurant due to its proximity to the Bridgehampton racetrack, a favorite stop on the Grand Prix formula car racing circuit.</p><p>Irma and her husband, Ken, purchased the restaurant in 2005 and have put their own spin on the restaurant while maintaining its charm. Herzog has recently upset many South Hampton residents by allowing Khloe and Kourtney Kardashain to rent some of her gallery space at 64 Jobs Lane in order to make room for their latest Dash store. Some of the local southamptonites feel Herzog betrayed their village by working with the Kardashians because they feel the Kardashians bring attention to the area that does not align with the local temperament. Khloe and Kourtney plan to film their next reality show, Kourtney & Khloe Take the Hamptons in the community, and the natives are thus far unimpressed. Apparently, this is not Herzog's first scandal as the community was up in arms a year previously over one of her workers being diagnosed with Hepatitis A. The problem was resolved quickly and the health inspector gave her restaurant a clean bill of health, but it did not stop the negative buzz from floating around the Hamptons.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97wa6qoqaVqMBusdeemq6smauytHvIq6SaZZiav7u7xmalnqxdrLyzwMdo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
