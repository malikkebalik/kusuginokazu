If you were a growing teenage girl, you probably enjoyed <a href=#>Taina</a>. Led by Life With Mikey alum Christina Vidal, the show followed a young Latina girl attending a performing arts high school with dreams of being a singer. It’s been 15 years since the show’s end. But, the show remains a classic. While fans hold out hope for a reunion, some of the show’s stars have gone on to do other projects. Here’s an update on what they’ve been up to since the show’s end.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Taina-cast-pose-together-on-the-red.-carpet.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Christina Vidal</strong></h2><p id=par-2_54>Vidal starred as the title character and the glue of her group of friends. There were rumors that her diva attitude was the reason <a href=#>the show was canceled</a>, and also suspicion that because the show had a core female audience, it was canned. According to Vidal, there were several reasons the show was canceled.</p><p id=par-3_44>She told the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LA Times</a>: “They [network executives] didn’t really say anything…just that they’d replace it with a show about Master P and his son, Vidal revealed to LA Times. “But I think it had something to do with me getting a record deal.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p>Source: YouTube</figure><p id=par-4_57>Vidal also admit that she did have some behavior issues. “I was just partying, I was late at times – sometimes unprepared,” she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2020. “My attitude wasn’t great, I was exhausted, and I was a kid trying to be responsible at work, but also being a teenager and going through normal teenager things.”</p><p id=par-5_44>Since the show’s end, she’s continued acting, with guest appearances on Girlfriends and Being Mary Jane. She also had a record deal with MCA for a brief time and turned down an offer to <a href=#>lead The Pussycat Dolls</a>.
