She has maintained a relatively low public profile since her husband’s conviction in December 2021. Thursday’s message on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">X</a> was her first post since June 2022, when she wrote about “road-tripping” to visit her “bestie – aka her husband — who is incarcerated in a Texas prison.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_61>Anna’s latest post came shortly after a jury in New York City found Trump guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in order to cover up payments made to Stormy Daniels, an adult film star with whom Trump had a sexual encounter in 2006. The historic verdict marks the first time a former president has been convicted of a crime.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_6>Reaction to Anna’s post was swift.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_40>“I guess you’re an expert on married men paying hush money to porn stars,” one person replied, referring to Josh’s alleged relationship with <a href=#>adult performer Danica Dillon</a>. In 2015, Dillon accused Josh of assaulting her during a paid sexual encounter.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_9>“You should know something about felons,” another person responded.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_12>“Girl, just delete this and go back into hiding,” one commenter suggested.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-duggar-family-has-supported-trump-in-the-past-nbsp>The Duggar family has supported Trump in the past&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-9_30>So far, no other members of the Duggar family have publicly reacted to the verdict in the Trump trial. But several have shown their support for him in the past.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_41>In 2017, the official Duggar family <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a> page praised the then-president, noting that evangelicals such as themselves “played a huge role” in his election. “We all know that we need to see our country turn back to God,” the post added.</p><p id=par-11_22>In 2019, Josh’s younger brother Justin Duggar mowed a message of support for Trump into the grass at the family’s Arkansas home.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_77>The Duggar family’s rise to national prominence began in politics. Patriarch Jim Bob Duggar served in the Arkansas House of Representatives for three years and ran for U.S. Senate in 2002. He failed to win the Republican primary, but photos of him and his wife Michelle Duggar campaigning with their many children caught the attention of national media, eventually leading to a series of TV specials and the TLC shows 19 Kids and Counting and Counting On.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-josh-duggar-was-active-in-republican-politics>Josh Duggar was active in Republican politics</h2><p id=par-13_105>At one point, Jim Bob and Michelle’s eldest son Josh was heavily involved in Republican politics. He worked for the conservative Family Research Council and hobnobbed with politicians such as Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum. But in 2015, he admitted to molesting several of his siblings when he was a teenager. Then, his name was exposed in a hack of the cheating website Ashley Madison. Josh resigned from his role with the Family Research Council and took a job running his family’s used car lot in Arkansas. It was there that he was arrested in 2021 on charges of possessing material depicting child sexual abuse.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_23>Despite his many scandals and controversies, Anna has <a href=#>remained loyal to her husband</a>, whom she married in 2008. The couple has seven children.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_56>“How could this happen in my marriage? Josh was my first love,” she said in 2015 in the wake of the Ashley Madison revelations. “I knew that my only hope was to cling to my faith. Because I knew if I went off of what I was feeling, I would turn a mess into a disaster.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-16_16>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, subscribe to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s YouTube channel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSur7rAZpuun5eWv26%2BxKysq56RmLK0edKomqKZnGK6prDImmSpqp9iwbPBzKlkra%2BVmsFvtNOmo2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
