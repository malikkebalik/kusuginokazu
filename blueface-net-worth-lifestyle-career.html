It&nbsp;is worth about $500K. It boasts more than 50 carats of diamonds and is considered one of the unique collections.</p><p>In mid-2019, Blueface unveiled his Bandana necklace worth over $500K crafted by <strong>Avianne & Co. The bandana</strong> features over 12,300 set stones and 130 carats of sky blue round cut diamonds built around 14-carat gold clasps.</p><p>Other than chains, this rapper has a custom teeth grill and multiple busts down watches from brands like <strong>Rolex, Audemars, and Patek.</strong></p><h3>Dressup</h3><p>Like most of the rappers, Blueface also likes to dress up hip-hop style. He mostly prefers baggy or loose clothing with unique graphic prints to pop out of the crowd.</p><p>Likewise, Porter is also a big fan of designer clothes, including Burberry and Gucci.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blueface-and-his-son-in-burberry.jpg><p>He is mostly seen wrapped in Burberry clothing with Balenciaga shoes on the feet.</p><p>The rapper also likes twinning with his son, who also happens to be wrapped in Burberry.</p><p>He also loves Gucci’s brand and is seen carrying his custom Gucci bags, belts, and shoes in events or any other shows.</p><h3>Vacations</h3><p>Porter travels a lot for his shows and appearances; however, there is very little news about him on vacation.</p><p>In contrast to hectic show schedules, he did manage some time to travel to Dubai for a vacation in 2019 and posted several social media posts to confirm the news.</p><p>Other than that, rapper Blueface has not been seen traveling anywhere outside the country for vacation.</p><h2>Charity</h2><p>Blueface is not widely known for his charity works, and there is not very much to talk about.</p><p>However, in December 2019, the 24-year-old rapper made it rain money at the residents of the “Skid Row” neighborhood in downtown Los Angeles.</p><p>The video documented with the caption “<strong>the season of giving</strong>” portrayed as Blueface’s unorthodox act of holiday charity. On the other hand, the video quickly went viral with online controversy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blueface-makes-it-rain-1024x576.jpg><p>Although the intention of the act may have been different, most criticized it as “dehumanizing.” This resulted in the rapper getting arrested under the charge of dehumanizing.</p><h2>Media, Investments, and Endorsements</h2><h3>Media</h3><p>The rapper made his first TV appearance in 2019 on BET Networks for Social awards 2019, where he performed his song “Thotiana.”</p><p>Except for the appearance, Blueface has mostly been featured in different YouTube channels.</p><p>For example, he appeared on Bigboy Tv for an interview, Complex YouTube channel where he goes sneaker shopping, and many other niches.</p><h3>Investments</h3><p>Blueface likes to keep his investments private and has not publicized the topic to his viewers.</p><h3>Endorsements</h3><p>A fraction of Blueface’s net worth also comes from endorsements and Instagram sponsors.</p><p>The rapper has recently signed a deal with a popular clothing brand Fashion Nova. Since then, the collaboration has released a product line of t-shirts that sells for $25.</p><p>Except for that, rapper Blueface has not been endorsed elsewhere.</p><p>Hopefully, we’ll see him rocking other brands as well.</p><h2>Blueface: Career</h2><p>The rapper’s music career began in January 2017 under the name Blueface Bleedem due to his ties with the schoolyard crips street gang.</p><p>He made his first impression upon being invited to his friend Ludiano’s music studio to retrieve a phone charger and then challenged to rap over a beat.</p><p>Eventually, he started to work to release his first song,<strong> “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Deadlocs</a>,”</strong> onto Soundcloud.</p><p>However, in October 2018, he released a music video for his song<strong> “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Respect My Cryppin</a>” </strong>on WorldstarHipHop’s YouTube channel.
