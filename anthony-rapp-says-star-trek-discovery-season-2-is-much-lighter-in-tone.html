Not that we’re complaining, mind you, as it still presented us with an excellent season of television, full of compelling characters and tantalizing plot twists. But for its sophomore outing, you can expect things to be a bit lighter.</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=294 data-injectable=false>Or at least, that’s according to Anthony Rapp. The actor, who plays Paul Stamets on the show, was speaking about the upcoming run at Star Trek Las Vegas the other week and explained that a lot of the darkness in season 1 came from the fact that Captain Lorca was from the Mirror Universe.</p><p>So much of the darkness was informed by the fact that our captain was from the Mirror Universe. Everything was geared toward telling that story. And how do we reach our ideals, sometimes you have to go through darkness to come out and realize what you really hold up to be true. So, yes it was unfamiliar in some ways, but it was still ultimately steeped in the tenets and beliefs in this universe, always. Going to humanity’s higher purpose. But, yes, it was unusually dark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/star-trek-discovery-premiere-004-1022780.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/star-trek-discovery-premiere-005-1022781.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/star-trek-discovery-premiere-006-1022782.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/star-trek-discovery-premiere-001-1022783.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/star-trek-discovery-premiere-002-1022784.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/star-trek-discovery-premiere-003-1022785.jpg><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>Given <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anson Mount’s introduction as Captain Pike in season 2</a>, things will lighten up considerably, with Rapp explaining that he sets a very different tone.</p><p>So in [season two] we have moved through this and come out the other side. Pike is sort of an exemplary captain. He is exactly the kind of familiar Starfleet captain you would always want. And I think that alone sets such a different tone. And yes, there is certainly more humor, but there is also this settling that happens after all the craziness of season one and all the massive events. Now, in season two, so much of it gets to settle and we get to deal with it. And there is time and space for all of that, which is really satisfying.</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>The second installment of CBS’&nbsp;<strong>Star Trek: Discovery</strong>&nbsp;series is expected to drop early next year, when&nbsp;Ethan Peck will be joining&nbsp;Sonequa Martin-Green and Co. on the flight deck <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as the legendary Spock</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yiutOhpqexXaeusbyMrJiyq12owaK%2BjK2pnqNdmba0r86vnKuxXaiyor%2FOp2RrZZmoeq7BwqFkpaGXncGmvoyipWasn6OycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
