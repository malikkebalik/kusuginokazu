I cannot thank you enough, the Dancing with the Stars family. It’s been such a wonderful experience for me.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_10>Goodman married professional dance instructor Sue Barrett in 2012.</p><p id=par-6_60>He told the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a>: “I knew I’d found the woman I wanted to be with for the rest of my life so why not get married?
