That year, Jones made her film debut as the character Janice Taylor in the movie “All the Rage.” In 2001, the actress appeared in her second film, titled “The Glass House.”</p><p id=par-3_45>Jones got her big break when she joined the cast of “Mad Men” in 2007. She played the role of Betty Francis (Betty Draper) until the show ended in 2015. Her other acting roles include appearances in “Love, Actually,” “X-Men: First Class,” and “The Last Man on Earth.”</p><h2>January Jones almost didn’t appear in ‘Mad Men’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/January-Jones-Mad-Men.jpg><p id=par-4_96>Jones almost missed out on the opportunity to star in “Mad Men.” In the May 2011 issue of “W” magazine, Jones says she originally auditioned for the role of Peggy. However, the part went to actress Elizabeth Moss. The role of Betty didn’t exist at the time, so Jones almost wasn’t on the show. “There was no Betty in the pilot when I auditioned,” Jones told the publication. “I read for Peggy two times – it was between me and Elizabeth Moss, who eventually got the part. At the end of the scene, there was a casual mention that Don [Draper] was married.”</p><p id=par-5_47>Matthew Weiner, the creator of “Mad Men,” wrote two more scenes featuring Betty. Jones told “W” magazine she decided to audition for that part a few days after her first audition. “He made me a verbal promise that the character would grow,” said Jones. “I took the part on faith.”</p><h2>January Jones’ highest-grossing films</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/January-Jones-X-Men-First-Class.jpg><p id=par-6_70>Jones has had a successful movie career.

Some fans compared “Spinning Out” to the 2010 film “Black Swan.”</p><p id=par-9_11><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=#>Daisy Ridley Net Worth and How She Makes Her Money</a></p><p id=par-10_6>Check out <a href=#>Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a> on Facebook!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3orrUmqmyZZqku6a%2FjKecrWWnpL%2B1tI2hq6akXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
