Although he wants the power of the Founding Titan, his plans for it remain up in the air, especially after he admits he would never <a href=#>go through with Zeke’s euthanization plan</a>. Attack on Titan Episode 80 finally reveals what Eren does want with the Founder — and it marks a dark turn for his character.</p><p id=par-2_11><strong>[Warning: This article contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Episode 80.]</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-eren-regains-the-upper-hand-in-attack-on-titan-episode-80>Eren regains the upper hand in ‘Attack on Titan’ Episode 80</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Attack-on-Titan-Season-4-Part-2-Eren.jpg><p id=par-3_68>Attack on Titan Episode 80, titled “From You, 2,000 Years Ago,” opens with a history of Ymir and the Titans. It shows the Founder’s tragic backstory and explains why she acts as a slave to anyone with royal blood. However, she breaks free of that pattern thanks to <a href=#>Eren Jaeger</a>. He convinces her to go against Zeke’s wishes — thus, claiming her power for his own ends.</p><p id=par-4_74>And as it turns out, Eren’s ends aren’t quite what anyone expected. Attack on Titan Season 4 leaves his friends wondering what his true intentions are for most of its run. But even Armin, who insisted Eren still had Paradis Island’s best interests in mind, couldn’t foresee how far his friend would go. As Eren enacts the Rumbling, it becomes clear he’s chosen a dark path in the name of protecting his people.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-attack-on-titan-season-4-reveals-eren-s-true-intentions-for-the-founder>‘Attack on Titan’ Season 4 reveals Eren’s true intentions for the Founder</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2 readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk562YZD9sU</p></figure><p id=par-5_45>So, what exactly are Eren’s plans for the Founder in Attack on Titan Season 4? Episode 80 reveals that Eren wants to remove all threats to Paradis Island and the Eldian people — but for him, that extends beyond Marley and its global alliance.</p><p id=par-6_43>Eren believes that the rest of the world will never stop killing the Eldian people. His solution is to send the Wall Titans to “trample every inch of the world beyond this island until every last life beyond our shores is wiped out.”</p><p id=par-7_61>He moves toward this goal by destroying the walls with the power of the Founder. “From You, 2,000 Years Ago” ends with the Colossus Titans marching away from Paradis Island. And that twist leaves viewers to wonder whether Eren will really go through with his plan — and if so, if the anime <a href=#>just turned its hero into a villain</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-did-season-4-just-turn-its-hero-into-a-villain>Did season 4 just turn its hero into a villain?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-8_54>With Eren determined to exterminate all of humanity, it seems <a href=#>Attack on Titan‘s main character</a> just became its villain in season 4. Although Eren is trying to protect his people, he’s becoming more like his enemy in the process. And if he doesn’t stop the Rumbling, he’ll reach a point of no return.</p><p id=par-9_56>The real question is whether his friends and comrades will attempt to stop him. Armin and Mikasa seem just as shocked as everyone else when Eren turns his sights on the rest of the world. And it’s hard to see the other members of the 104th Cadet Corps going along with the slaughter of innocent people.</p><p id=par-10_57>Of course, they may have their hands full with the walls collapsing — and there’s no telling if they can actually stop the Colossus Titans. Perhaps they can talk some sense into Eren before he goes through with his plan. Fans will have to tune in for the next installment to learn how things play out.</p><p id=par-11_18>New episodes of Attack on Titan Season 4 Part 2 drop every Sunday on Crunchyroll, Funimation, and Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSutcDAnKJmp55iwarAwKdkrJ2RqLyveZNmqZ6ulZa5tHnEq5ynZZakwq%2BwxKtloaydoXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
