On Sunday, June 12, 2022, after spending the night out with friends, Gwen Casten, a recent graduate of Downers Grove North High School in Downers Grove, Illinois, returned home. The following morning, her body was discovered. Why did this occur? When did Gwen pass away, and why?</p><h2>Sean Casten Daughter Autopsy</h2><p>Dr. Hilary Strawn McElligott, the hospital’s head pathologist, concluded after months of research that Ms. Casten died from a “sudden arrhythmogenic cardiac event of a natural but unspecified etiology,” which fits the clinical presentation of the patient’s symptoms.</p><p>An arrhythmia, also known as an irregular heartbeat, is a condition in which the heart beats excessively rapidly, too slowly, or at an irregular pace, as defined by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Without treatment, arrhythmias can cause a stroke, heart failure, or even death.</p><p>Casten reported Gwen’s death that morning on June 13, 2022, via his social media accounts that night. A picture of Gwen and a statement from Casten, Kara, and their daughter Audrey were posted online on June 15th, two days later.</p><p><strong>Take a look at below tweet:</strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>We are grateful to all who have reached out with thoughts, condolences and help. To all asking what they can do, we ask only that you live your lives as Gwen lived hers. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/AdQTpzsnTP</a></p><p>— Rep. Sean Casten (@RepCasten) <a href=# rel=noopener>June 15, 2022</a></p><p>“On Sunday night, we had dinner as a family, and then she went out with some friends for a few hours,” the statement said. She arrived home, bade Kara and me goodnight, texted a friend to make sure she was OK, and then failed to awaken on Monday.</p><p>The Casten family noted at the time that they were uncertain of the circumstances surrounding Gwen’s passing, but comforted themselves with the knowledge “that it was peaceful.”</p><p><strong>You can also take a look at below posts:</strong></p><h2>Sean Casten Daughter Cause of Death</h2><p>Rep. Casten is a chemical engineer and sustainability advocate who founded a business before entering politics in the 2010s. In 2018, he was first elected to office. The sixth congressional district of Illinois is still represented by him.</p><p>Gwen was active in several extracurriculars throughout high school, and she was also a talented musician and activist. According to the Casten family statement, she participated in a high school production of Mary Poppins in the spring of 2022 and found tremendous satisfaction in playing the trumpet.</p><p>She took her call for social justice with the same level of seriousness. Gwen brought together many of her classmates when she founded the Empowerment Club, a school club that discusses gun violence, environmental rights, and other issues.</p><p>Gwen, his daughter, shared his enthusiasm for eco-friendly technology and was applying to colleges that offered Environmental Science degrees.
