Many know <a href=#>Matthew McConaughey’s famous lines</a> from his breakout film as they’ve followed him through many other successful projects. We know McConaughey has a high <a href=#>net worth</a>, but what about some of his costars?</p><h2>Who is worth more since ‘Dazed and Confused’ — Matthew McConaughey or Ben Affleck?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dazed-and-Confused-1.jpg><p id=par-2_47>Both McConaughey and Dazed and Confused co-star <a href=#>Ben Affleck</a> went on to create profitable careers. Each has had his share of box office flops, but the majority of projects include big-ticket titles — even if from behind the camera (such as Affleck’s screenwriting, directorial, and producing roots).</p><p id=par-3_31>With projects like the critically-acclaimed Good Will Hunting and Argo — both of which won numerous awards — Affleck’s net worth is an estimated $150 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p id=par-4_33>McConaughey quickly became the face of rom-coms after his Dazed and Confused stint. He eventually moved onto more serious, dramatic projects like Dallas Buyer’s Club. His estimated net worth is around $140 million.</p><h2>Wiley Wiggins changed careers</h2><p id=par-5_34>Wiggins played a new freshman, Mitch Kramer. He was just 16 years old at the time of filming and went on to appear in a handful of other projects. Then, he chose another path.</p><p id=par-6_23>Wiggins began writing for computer-related publications such as Fringeware Review, Mondo 2000, and Boing Boing before creating the weblog, “It’s Not For Everyone.”</p><p id=par-7_16>Now, the star works in the computer field full-time. His estimated net worth is around $300,000.</p><h2>Parker Posey vs. Joey Lauren Adams</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Parker-Posey.jpg><p id=par-8_38>Many remember Posey as Darla — the queen of freshman hazing. Following Dazed and Confused, Posey had a string of ’90s projects that took off, quickly becoming “queen of the indies.” Her estimated net worth is $10 million.</p><p id=par-9_40>Adams was also part of the senior hazing group, as well as Jason London’s girlfriend, Simone. She went on to star in a few of Affleck’s projects like <a href=#>Chasing Amy and Mall Rats</a>. Her net worth is around $2 million.</p><h2>Adam Goldberg didn’t create ‘The Goldbergs’, FYI</h2><p id=par-10_55>Don’t be “dazed and confused” by this star having the same name as The Goldbergs creator Adam F. Goldberg (whose net worth is $10 million). Their net worth is quite different. The Dazed and Confused actor and musician — who has appeared in <a href=#>Saving Private Ryan</a>, Friends, and more — is worth around $6 million.</p><h2>Which London brother is worth more?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Jason-London-1.jpg><p id=par-11_1>RELATED:</p><p id=par-12_38>As Randall “Pink” Floyd in Dazed and Confused, Jason London followed his success with stints in Criminal Minds, Grey’s Anatomy, and even as Alicia Silverstone’s love interest in the Aerosmith video for “Amazin’.” He’s worth an estimated $800,000.</p><p id=par-13_31>Jason’s identical twin brother Jeremy — who served as Jason’s stunt double in Dazed and Confused — has appeared in 7th Heaven, <a href=#>Party of Five</a>, and more. He’s worth around $300,000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6osDToZywZZ2YsLC6wK6eoZ2pYra0ecOooKefXayyrbiMm6ytZaedrrV5yKxkraCVYrumwIywpqusmGK8p3nHoqpmnJGvsqV5wKebZpufo7O2v8SdZJyno6mus7%2BNoaumpF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
