I felt satisfied with the food that kept appearing in front of me and didn't feel the need to get more food on the way home.&nbsp;</p><p>We did end up taking home some leftovers, but they didn't make it more than 10 minutes on my kitchen counter before we dove in. The munchies phenomenon is real, after all.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking back on the experience, I saw that it really was a trial run for THC dinner parties of the future. While at the table, servers told us we were being given 10 milligrams each with the cucumbers and that the Korean fried chicken had no THC in it. But after checking in with Lee in the days following, I discovered we were actually given 5 milligrams each with the cucumbers and that the fried chicken had 10 milligrams of THC drizzled on top.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you're someone who wants to be 100% certain of how much THC you're taking in, I would recommend checking in with the chef specifically.&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, we were each served 15 milligrams total throughout the two-hour seating. The highs came in waves. At first, after eating the cucumbers and fried chicken, I got a pretty intense wave for around 10 minutes. For me, it was a light, happy, head high similar to the one I've experienced when smoking weed. But my dinner date said she experienced more of a body high that reminded her of ingesting oil (It's important to remember that the THC can affect everyone differently). I felt another small wave toward the end of the dinner, but that only lasted one or two minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>The night made me both excited and hopeful for more restaurants to host similar experiences, something Razo told me is likely to happen soon.</p><p>"I'm happy I did it," Lee told me the day after the event. "It meant a huge step forward [in terms of] just breaking the stigma," which he said is even more prominent in the Asian community. "I feel like the black sheep doing this, but I'm confident [in my decision to] host an event like this."&nbsp;</p><p>Lee and Drip Lab are hosting the event again this year on April 20 with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>tickets for sale on Resy</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufonyxtM6tpqxlp52utXnIrapmpJmgsm7Ax5xksJ2VmXqltc2nnKtloJa%2FtcWMp7CcZZyatKK4yLOYraGfo3pzfJFqZG0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
