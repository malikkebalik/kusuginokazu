Yes, these stars are piled on with a ton of makeup and yes, lighting plays an effect. But to such a drastic degree? I don’t think so.</p><p>Nicki has always been an incredibly talented musician and when you look at her in 2010 before she really ‘broke out’, she looked natural and beautiful – although she still put way too much makeup on. However, as she got more and more famous, you could start to see how her face slowly changed.</p><p><a rel=nofollow href=#><img decoding=async title="Nicki Minaj Whitening or Bleaching Her Skin - Is Nicki Lighter-Skinned Now?

It also seemed to contour her nose to appear thinner, and of course, who could forget the crazy eye makeup? Part of it could very well <a rel=nofollow href=#>be theatrics</a>, but it really does seem like there was a huge level of insecurity playing its part. I mean, she lost a TON of weight over the years, and we know the pressure that musicians and actresses face to lose weight in Hollywood.</p><p><a rel=nofollow href=#><img decoding=async title="Nicki Minaj Whitening or Bleaching Her Skin - Is Nicki Lighter-Skinned Now?

It’s not just in magazine covers and photoshoots – where airbrushing and lighting play a big role in creating the images – but in candids. Even with natural light, her skin clearly looks lighter. Whether that’s just the work of some crazy futuristic makeup or skin lightening products, I guess we won’t really know.</p><p><a rel=nofollow href=#><img decoding=async alt="Nicki Minaj Signing Copies Of Her Album 'Pink Friday' At Best Buy" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebdirtylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/nicki_minaj_natural.jpg width=500 height=640 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Photo Credit: FameFlynet</p><p>If You Want More Hot Celeb Dirty Laundry News Then Please&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Like Us On Facebook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Follow Us On Twitter</a>!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaGxnnp6wrLWMpqCnmZpiwKy1zWajop%2BYqbKzedahoK2dnp67qHnBpZyam5ieu6h51qGgrZ1dZYNzgY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
