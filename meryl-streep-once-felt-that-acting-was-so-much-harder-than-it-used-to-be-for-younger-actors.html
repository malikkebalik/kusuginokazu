As a veteran that many idolize, Streep has sometimes used her platform to impart words of wisdom on her younger peers.</p><p id=par-4_29>This included telling actors that they shouldn’t concern themselves too much with their looks while pursuing a role. Doing so could only distract someone from working on their craft.</p><p id=par-5_34>“My advice: don’t waste so much time worrying about your skin or your weight. Develop what you do, what you put your hands on in the world,” Streep once said according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stage Milk</a>.</p><p id=par-6_44>It wasn’t a mistake <a href=#>the Oscar-winner</a> felt actors only made, either. She found that casting directors and filmmakers could also put a bit too much emphasis on an actor’s aesthetics. This could often lead to a filmmaker overlooking other qualities a performer might offer.</p><p id=par-7_66>“I hate those meetings where you just go in and sit down – they just want to have a look at you. Well, then that’s all they’re gonna get – a look at you. And a ‘look at you’ is nothing. It’s nothing! You’ve got to imagine and see people’s work, because people’s work is where you’ll find whether they can do this thing,” Streep said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meryl-streep-once-shared-why-acting-was-harder-nowadays-than-it-used-to-be>Meryl Streep once shared why acting was harder nowadays than it used to be</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_36>Streep felt that acting may have become more challenging for other actors on the rise. She confided that there was more of a spotlight on celebrity appearances than there were back in the older days.</p><p id=par-9_37>“The world was different when I was a young actress,” Streep once told Stylist (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Spy</a>). “These days there’s so much scrutiny, everyone’s so self-aware, and that self-consciousness is the thing that kills your acting ability.”</p><p id=par-10_26><a href=#>The Mamma Mia star</a> noticed a possible trend with the newer generation of actors where they might have been focusing on what she once advised against.</p><p id=par-11_33>“What you look like, and how you seem, is all young actors consume themselves with, instead of their characters. It makes it so much harder to be fresh all the time,” she said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meryl-streep-was-once-told-she-wasn-t-pretty-enough-for-king-kong>Meryl Streep was once told she wasn’t pretty enough for ‘King Kong’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-12_53>Even Streep might have been misjudged or lost out on a role because of someone’s opinion on her appearance. In the mid-70s, Streep went to <a href=#>audition for a King Kong feature</a>. But a producer at the time rejected Streep, feeling that the actor wasn’t attractive enough for the role she was screening for.</p><p id=par-13_24>“‘I’m sorry I’m not beautiful enough to be in King Kong,'” Streep remembered telling the producer in an interview on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Graham Norton Show</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6pr7YpWSsrKKasrF5xZ6jrWWRmMGqusZmpK6bmGK1or7DnqlmraOasW7Fzq6loJ2iYq6kwM6rqmegpKK5cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
