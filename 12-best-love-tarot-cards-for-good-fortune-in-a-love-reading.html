They appear when something extraordinary happens, something important, and an opportunity for a life-altering lesson.</p><p>Therefore you should pay extra attention when a Major Arcana card appears in your love tarot reading.</p><h3 id=the-lovers-i-choose-you class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">THE LOVERS: “I CHOOSE YOU.”</h3><p>Of course, you’d want to see this card in a love tarot reading!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn-lkbff.nitrocdn.com/sTnyCEOWfGiIpLjCvEilsTGqVqpXJmFP/assets/images/optimized/rev-3b3f5c3/www.alittlesparkofjoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wands-tarot-love-1.jpg><p>One common misconception about the Lovers, however, is that it signals a new love interest. In fact, it’s more common that the appearance of this tarot card signals a current friendship or romance moving to a deeper level.</p><p>Your intentions and desires are aligned, and so you can move closer to each other.</p><p>If you receive&nbsp;<a href=#>the Lovers</a>, there is a relationship in your life that could soon become more intimate.</p><p>The card is a sign that you can make your feelings and intentions clear with confidence that they will be reciprocated.</p><p>Some questions you can ask yourself to make the most of Lovers energy:</p><ul><li>What and how do I want to communicate my feelings to my lover?</li><li>What do I need to receive to feel seen and understood in the relationship?</li><li>How can I help my lover feel seen and understood?&nbsp;</li></ul><h3 id=the-empress-im-ready-for-love class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">THE EMPRESS: “I’M READY FOR LOVE.”</h3><p>The Empress is an excellent card for love because it means you have done the work to open yourself to a mutually beneficial relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn-lkbff.nitrocdn.com/sTnyCEOWfGiIpLjCvEilsTGqVqpXJmFP/assets/images/optimized/rev-3b3f5c3/www.alittlesparkofjoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/four-of-wands-1.jpg><p>Sometimes this card appears for single people who have learned to take care of themselves—they’re thriving in the world, and others are attracted to that glow.</p><p>A partnered person may draw the card when their self-care is generating a more nourishing energy in the relationship.</p><p>If you receive&nbsp;<a href=#>the Empress</a>, let higher love find its way to you. Whatever your current relationship situation is, this is a sign that a gentle, nurturing transition will bring about a deeper understanding of the potential of caring intimacy.</p><p>Some questions you can ask yourself to make the most of Empress energy:</p><ul><li>What boundaries could exist in my relationship to ensure I’m taking care of myself?</li><li>How do I nurture my partner without losing myself in that role?</li></ul><h3 id=the-hierophant-lets-make-it-official class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">THE HIEROPHANT: “LET’S MAKE IT OFFICIAL.”</h3><p>It might come to a surprise that I included the Hierophant as a love tarot card. Indeed, there are some negative associations with this card.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn-lkbff.nitrocdn.com/sTnyCEOWfGiIpLjCvEilsTGqVqpXJmFP/assets/images/optimized/rev-3b3f5c3/www.alittlesparkofjoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pentacles-love-tarot-1.jpg><p>Sure,&nbsp;<a href=#>the Hierophant</a>&nbsp;as the Pope-like figure issuing decrees from his throne can be boring, stodgy, and conventional. But this figure also represents the long history of rituals that can give relationships meaning.</p><p>If you receive the Hierophant, a ceremony or ritual may occur that defines your relationship in a significant way. In the most traditional sense, this means marriage.</p><p>But let’s face it: there are all kinds of personal rituals, especially for younger people. The Hierophant signals any meaningful step, which could be as simple as introducing your partner to close friends.</p><p>Some questions you can ask yourself to make the most of Hierophant energy:</p><ul><li>What does commitment mean to me?</li><li>How will I define my role within this relationship?</li><li>How does my relationship contribute to my sense of belonging?</li></ul><h3 id=the-sun-theres-something-to-celebrate class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">THE SUN: “THERE’S SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE!”</h3><p>In the Major Arcana,&nbsp;<a href=#>the Sun</a>&nbsp;follows&nbsp;<a href=#>the Star</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>the Moon</a>, two cards that bring hope alongside difficult lessons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn-lkbff.nitrocdn.com/sTnyCEOWfGiIpLjCvEilsTGqVqpXJmFP/assets/images/optimized/rev-3b3f5c3/www.alittlesparkofjoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/queen-of-pentacles-1.jpg><p>When night ends, though, the bright day is undeniable. The Sun always brings positive energy. It is the most powerfully affirming card in the tarot deck.</p><p>If you receive the Sun in a love tarot reading, a celebratory event is on the horizon. This could be anything that heightens joy in your love life.</p><p>If you and your partner are trying for a child, this might mean&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>confirmation of pregnancy</a>. Are you searching for a house? You’ll close the deal. If you and your love interest have been kept apart, this card is a sign that obstacles like distance will soon disappear.</p><p>Some questions you can ask yourself to make the most of Sun energy:</p><ul><li>What can I do to be fully present to bask in this joy with my lover?</li><li>How can we share our joy with others?</li></ul><h2 id=love-tarot-cups-cards class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">LOVE TAROT CUPS CARDS</h2><p>Cups represent intense and deep emotions, so it makes sense that many cards of this suit would bode well for love.</p><h3 id=two-of-cups-i-love-the-way-we-communicate class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">TWO OF CUPS: “I LOVE THE WAY WE COMMUNICATE.”</h3><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Two of Cups</a>, in particular, is a mini Lovers card. If the Lovers indicates a new level for your relationship, the Two of Cups is a small moment of triumph in communication.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn-lkbff.nitrocdn.com/sTnyCEOWfGiIpLjCvEilsTGqVqpXJmFP/assets/images/optimized/rev-3b3f5c3/www.alittlesparkofjoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/love-tarot-reading-1.jpg><p>If you receive this minor arcana card, you and a love interest or partner may have a&nbsp;<a href=#>conversation</a>&nbsp;or even an argument during which you learn something new about each other.</p><p>As a result of your vulnerability and openness, your love will feel newly invigorated.</p><p>Some questions you can ask yourself to make the most of this energy:</p><ul><li>Which words make me feel most heard and validated?</li><li>What does my partner need to feel understood?</li><li>How can we negotiate to a place that affirms both of us?</li></ul><h3 id=ten-of-cups-i-deserve-to-find-joy-in-love class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">TEN OF CUPS: “I DESERVE TO FIND JOY IN LOVE.”</h3><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Ten of Cups</a>&nbsp;is so overwhelmingly happy that it can inspire doubt.

You have or will soon have everything you need to feel complete in your relationship and yourself.</p><p>Often this card comes with implications for family: your relationship can successfully support and inspire others (like children).</p><p>Some questions you can ask yourself to make the most of this energy:</p><ul><li>What’s making the relationship work, and how can that be nourished?</li><li>How does your sense of family support you and those around you?</li></ul><h3 id=knight-of-cups-this-love-excites-and-inspires-me class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">KNIGHT OF CUPS: “THIS LOVE EXCITES AND INSPIRES ME.”</h3><p>Get ready to be swept away. Nothing can prepare for the delightful and sometimes overwhelming&nbsp;<a href=#>love energy of the Knight of Cups</a>. When it comes, let go and enjoy it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>If you receive the Knight of Cups, there may be someone who enters your life to shift your definition of love.</p><p>You have not had a love like this before, and you can grow exponentially if you let it in. Your sense of pleasure will also expand.</p><p>Because this card is a bit like diving headfirst into a wave, be sure you have what you need to make it through the exhilarating ride intact.</p><p>Some questions you can ask yourself to make the most of this energy:</p><ul><li>How am I different in ways that serve me because of this relationship?</li><li>What do I love the most about this person, and why?</li><li>How can I maintain my sense of self outside the relationship in this exciting time?&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 id=love-tarot-wands-cards class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">LOVE TAROT WANDS CARDS</h2><p>Associated with the element of fire, Wands aren’t passive cards.

In the case of the&nbsp;<a href=#>Four of Wands</a>, the cause for celebration is a romantic union.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>If you receive the Four of Wands, you are on the brink of an engagement or deeper romantic commitment. Send the announcement or change your relationship status online.</p><p>If you are single and not necessarily seeking a long-term partner, this card can mean you are taking steps to enjoy that life.

For love, this heralds a shared success that both partners can enjoy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>If you receive the Six of Wands, use what you have learned in a time of conflict to build stronger foundations with someone.</p><p>Because Wands are typical for younger relationships, this could be an early argument that clarifies what you both believe and desire.</p><p>If you are in a committed relationship, you may feel as though you can accomplish anything together.</p><p>Some questions you can ask yourself to make the most of this energy:</p><ul><li>What helped us most in difficult times so that we can enjoy this time now?</li><li>How can we be sure these lessons continue to support us in future conflicts?</li></ul><h2 id=love-tarot-pentacles-cards class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">LOVE TAROT PENTACLES CARDS</h2><p>Pentacles are concerned with the material realm. When they appear in relationship and love tarot readings, they often point to the things that bring security to your partnerships so that they will thrive.</p><h3 id=ten-of-pentacles-i-am-safe-with-you class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">TEN OF PENTACLES: “I AM SAFE WITH YOU.”</h3><p>If you receive the&nbsp;<a href=#>Ten of Pentacles</a>, you are entering or sustaining a relationship with a mature and dependable partner who makes you feel safe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>You can count on this person to stand by you.

Because the card assures you that you have developed a strong sense of self, you are open to supportive love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>If you receive the&nbsp;<a href=#>Queen of Pentacles</a>&nbsp;in a love tarot reading, someone in your life is supporting your personal growth. Whatever you want in a relationship, you can ask for it now.</p><p>Perhaps you are ready for motherhood, or you’d like to make a career transition after having a baby. Your love can support your needs now.</p><p>Some questions you can ask yourself to make the most of this energy:</p><ul><li>What do you want from a secure relationship?</li><li>In what ways can you support those who support you?</li></ul><h2 id=a-note-on-the-absence-of-swords-in-love-tarot class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">A NOTE ON THE ABSENCE OF SWORDS IN LOVE TAROT</h2><p>What are the associations you have with the word “sword”? Swords are weapons, and they usually indicate times when tensions are high.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In general, swords are a truth-seeking suit. In some cases, this could progress a partnership, especially if other cards support a love tarot reading. For example, the&nbsp;<a href=#>Ace of Swords</a>&nbsp;and the Two of Cups might mean that speaking a difficult truth improves your&nbsp;<a href=#>relationship</a>.</p><p>While Swords are sometimes necessary for progress, they rarely suggest an easy or secure time in love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Consider the imagery on the traditional Rider-Waite cards: burdens, blindfolds, and bleeding abound. If you receive Swords in a love tarot reading, you are being asked to step back and reflect on the current situation. Is it really as it seems? Is it really what you want?</p><h2 id=a-final-note-on-upright-court-cards-in-love-tarot-readings class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">A FINAL NOTE ON UPRIGHT COURT CARDS IN LOVE TAROT READINGS</h2><p>Some&nbsp;<a href=#>court cards</a>&nbsp;are definitive positive indicators for love, but all court cards that appear in a love tarot reading may represent people: friends, lovers, and partners.</p><p>The suit and rank of the card speak to a love interest’s characteristics and how they influence your love life.</p><p>Some card readers also link the elements of each suit with Zodiac signs. For instance, a court card of Wands would represent a person born under a Fire sign (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius). Cups are Water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces), Swords are Air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius), and Pentacles are Earth signs (<a href=#>Taurus</a>, Virgo, Capricorn).&nbsp;</p><p>The interaction of the court cards with other cards in the reading may show how a person will behave or how your actions will impact them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orjIraulnaOlrrO3zp%2BhqLFemLyue8uorZ5lpJa%2FsMCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
