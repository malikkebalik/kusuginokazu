He allowed him the use of the computers at his firm, in exchange for animation work. This led to Sharlto Copley producing and appearing in some of Blomkamp's early projects, including "Alive in Joburg". In 2009, "Alive in Joburg" was turned into the feature length film, "District 9", and he played the lead role. The film was a massive success, and led to more and more acting work. Since then, he has appeared in co-starring and starring roles in such projects as "The A-Team", "Elysium", "Oldboy", "Europa Report", and "Old Grave". He is next slated to appear in "Maleficent", "Hardcore", and "Chappie".</p><p>Real Estate</p><p>In 2013, Sharlto paid $860,000 for a home in Los Angeles.
