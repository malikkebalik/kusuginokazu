Let’s shed some light on the same.</p><h2 id=h-why-did-lohan-shift-to-dubai data-injectable=false><strong>Why did Lohan shift to Dubai?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Getty-Images-Lindsay-Lohan.jpg><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>While Dubai is renowned for its active life, opulence, and glaring extravaganza, for Lohan, the feeling of calmness and solitude drove her to settle there.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>The 35-year-old actress <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told in Vogue’s ‘Life in Looks’</a> series that she “felt a certain sense of calm” after moving to ‘Jewel of the Middle East,’ a respite from the daily encounters with the Paparazzi and living a ‘normal life.’ Talking about the subject, she said,</p><p>“I think it’s because paparazzi is illegal there. I really found that I had a private life, and I could just take time for myself. I decided to stay there because I really learned to appreciate what it is to go, do my work, and then leave and live a normal life. It took me moving there to really appreciate the time that I take for myself, instead of just going, going, going, and learning to say ‘no.’ And really putting myself first, and choosing the things that I want to do, wisely, for me first.”</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>Lohan’s first visit to Dubai was in 2008 during the opening of The Atlantis, Palm, but she settled in the city in 2014. In a 2018 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">W Magazine</a>, the Freaky Friday star briefed in detail her experience of living in Dubai, which, in her opinion, was much more comfortable than London, where she resided for a few years before moving to Dubai. Speaking on the subject, she stated,</p><p>“I felt so relieved when I moved everything over from London to&nbsp;Dubai&nbsp;and I saw everything in one place. Now I don’t have to open suitcases and live out of hotels and bags. Everything is where it should be. It’s a cleansing of your head, which is what I needed, and it took me a while to do it…”</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false>Setting aside convenience, luxury, and comfort, Dubai has another significance in Lohan’s life as this is where she discovered the love of her life, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bader Shammas</a>. The pair met in a restaurant in 2021 and tied the knot the following year.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=false>The actress opened up about her relationship with Shammas with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Allure</a> in June 2023, saying that the pair were immediately attracted to each other, culminating in their marriage. Today, the couple have a son and live a blissful married life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqcWMnaaeq12htq%2Bw0pqwZqSfna6vecuirZ5lmaN6pcHBmqBo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
