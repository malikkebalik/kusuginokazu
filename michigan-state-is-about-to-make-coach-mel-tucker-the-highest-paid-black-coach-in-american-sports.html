The Spartans won their first eight games and are currently sitting at seventh in the College Football Playoff rankings with a 9-1 record. It's a marked turnaround from last year's shortened season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, when the Spartans only won two games en route to a disappointing finish.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>With this season of success, the university is about to reward head coach Mel Tucker in a major way.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The university is finalizing a ten-year deal with Tucker, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>per the Detroit Free Press</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>. The price tag?</span></p><h2><strong>$95 million</strong></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>The deal would be the largest ever offered to a Black coach in NCAA history and will make Tucker the highest-paid Black coach in American sports.

After former Michigan State head coach <a href=# title="Mark Dantonio Net Worth">Mark Dantonio</a> suddenly retired in February 2020, the Spartans hired Tucker away from the Colorado Buffaloes. Tucker was making $2.4 million in Colorado when the Spartans offered a six-year deal.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This new deal would likely override the remaining four years on Tucker's current contract, but would nearly double the salary he makes each season.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For now, though, he's focused on getting the Spartans to the College Football Playoff, where a potential national championship awaits.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqagnKCZnK6vedKtmK2dXZ7Abq3BqKytZaSkeq6typ5knKeRmLVuucSlZK2tk6Cys3nToZxmoJmctaa%2F02anmqGUYq%2BtrcKkZJynkZi1brXNZpimnaKesKK6jKynqKqkqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
