Known for her child acting roles and adult reality personality, Richards has spent the past twelve years steadily climbing the ladder of success, proving that, like fine wine, she only gets better with age.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=592 data-current-count=973 data-injectable=true>Richards’ claim to fame was her childhood role as Lindsay Wallace in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Halloween</a>. If you need help remembering who Lindsay is, she was the young girl Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) was babysitting when Michael Myers came to kill her. The low-budget film took the world by storm and became one of the biggest horror movies of all time, cementing Richards’ place in the movie’s history. This eventually led to Richards’ reprisal of the adult version of Lindsay Wallace forty-one years later in the 2021 sequel to the film, Halloween Kills, and will continue with Halloween Ends.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=532 data-current-count=832 data-injectable=true>When she isn’t dodging homicidal murderers, Richards is busy putting out fires (and sometimes starting them) in her hit reality show, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. As one of the many spin-offs in the Real Housewives franchise, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, which premiered in 2010, has become one of the most successful in the franchise. To date, Richards is the only remaining Housewife from the original group of Beverly Hills housewives. The show’s twelfth season will premiere Wednesday, May 11 on Bravo.</p><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true>In addition to all of her professional successes, Kyle Richards is also a mother of four daughters. Her eldest daughter, Farrah Aldjufrie, is from her first marriage to Guraish Aldjufrie. Her other three daughters — Alexia Umansky, Sophia Umansky, and Portia Umansky — are from her second marriage to Mauricio Umansky, the real estate mogul and Founder and CEO of The Agency, the billion-dollar brokerage that’s taken the real estate world by storm.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-what-is-kyle-richards-net-worth data-injectable=false><strong>What is Kyle Richards’ Net Worth?</strong></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kyle Richards Umansky (@kylerichards18)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=548 data-current-count=848 data-injectable=true>Kyle Richards’ net worth is estimated to be around $100 million, which is largely thanks to her successful reality TV career and businesses. Per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Radar Online</a>, a favorite outlet used by the stars on the show, Richards makes $500,000 per season. Along with her sometimes-controversial role on the show, she is also known for her businesses, namely luxury clothing line, Kyle by Alene Too, which closed its doors in 2018, and current clothing line Kyle x Shahida. If you factor all those in, it makes sense why she has such an impressive net worth.</p><h3 id=h-how-old-is-kyle-richards data-injectable=false><strong>How old is Kyle Richards?</strong></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kyle Richards Umansky (@kylerichards18)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>Although she hardly looks a day over 40, Kyle Richards was born January 11, 1969, which makes her 53 years old as of this writing.</p><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>For someone who’s been in the public eye for as long as Richards has and has had to deal with the stress that comes with public scrutiny, it’s amazing how well she’s taken care of herself. Her secret to looking young?
