CJ left the island with self-proclaimed “Fboy” Jarred Evans to continue their relationship. Meanwhile, Nakia left with OG Jared Motley, who turned out to be a genuine “nice guy.” However, Garrett Morosky and Sarah left the show on the rocks. Who is still together from the&nbsp;<a href=#>reality TV</a>&nbsp;show&nbsp;FBoy Island&nbsp;Season 1?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fboy-island-season-1-are-garrett-and-sarah-still-together><strong>‘FBoy Island’ Season 1: Are Garrett and Sarah still together?</strong></h2><p id=par-2_78>Garrett Morosky and Sarah Emig are not together. After he revealed his true colors in the&nbsp;FBoy Island&nbsp;Season 1 finale on HBO, the couple did not continue a relationship. Although Emig knew that Garrett labeled himself an “FBoy,” and had a very recent&nbsp;<a href=#>relationship with&nbsp;Love Island’s&nbsp;Lauren Coogan</a>, she chose to continue a relationship with him. Emig felt he had changed for the better. However, Morosky decided to break off the connection in the finale to take the money and run.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_74>In a strange twist, host Nikki Glaser revealed that Morosky did not get to keep the $100,000 cash prize. Instead, he had to donate the money to a charity of Emig’s choice. The couple did not date after the show, although&nbsp;<a href=#>Morosky and Emig were caught hanging out</a>&nbsp;together. Hopefully, it was for an apology. Nothing further came of the relationship. Morosky recently shared photos on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;of himself at Coachella holding hands with Australian model Casey Boonstra.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>‘FBoy Island’ Season 1: Are Jarred Evans and CJ Franco still together in 2022?</strong></h2><p id=par-4_64>New Jarred Evans and CJ Franco from&nbsp;FBoy Island&nbsp;Season 1 are no longer together.
