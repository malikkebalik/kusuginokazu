I’m surrounded by Southern Baptists and I’m sort of fine with it. My new neighbors are this young Duggar-esque Baptist family with like four kids under the age of five. Last Christmas, I gave all of the kids holiday M&M packages and they were thrilled. This is my thought process: I probably don’t agree with any of their beliefs, but they make for great neighbors.</p><p>Anyway, since I’m surrounded by Southern Baptists, I spend too much time thinking about how professional religious people make a living. It’s actually pretty easy – Professional Christianity is a growth industry. There are books/publishing, lecture circuits, religious schools (nursery, K-12, college, graduate schools can all have religious affiliations), reality shows, Christian entertainment, plus the old stand-by: actually being employed by a church. I know the Duggar Family has a reality show, but with so many kids, that’s probably not the extent of their income. I would imagine that someone like Jill Duggar is also giving paid speeches, being paid to endorse certain campaigns or products, plus she probably has some other revenue streams (she’s studying to be a midwife). My point is that… I doubt Jill Duggar is rich, but she’s probably got enough money where she doesn’t need to do the baby registry at Walmart. And she definitely doesn’t have to include Gatorade on her baby registry.</p><p>Ask and you shall receive! Jill Duggar and Derick Dillard are gearing up for their first baby by registering for gifts at their local Walmart! According to their wish list, the 19 Kids and Counting stars are asking for a mix of everyday items and a few splurges.</p><p>For example, the couple requests Purell hand sanitizer, Bounty paper towels, Arm & Hammer detergent, Boudreaux’s butt paste and even an eight-pack of orange flavored Gatorade. Hey, new moms need replenishing too. There are also several items friends and family can purchase at a higher price. The couple’s most expensive item is a $199 stroller followed by a newborn napper station at $159. As of Tuesday afternoon, already 64 gifts have been purchased as the couple eagerly waits for the March 24, 2015 due date.</p><p>“We are so excited for this new little blessing and look forward to the arrival of ‘Baby Dilly’ in March 2015,” the couple wrote on the registry. The TLC reality stars recently learned their firstborn will be a handsome boy. They discovered the news during a gender-revealing ultrasound Saturday.</p><p>“Oh yes, there was some screaming in the room,” Jill recalled to People magazine. “I thought all along we were having a girl. Everyone made their guesses.” Before the ultrasound, Derick admitted that he “was praying for a big, healthy baby.”</p><p>In the meantime, the happy couple is simply enjoying their pregnancy journey and not thinking too much about the baby’s name.</p><p>“We are not going to do a letter theme,” Jill shared. “But we may do some kind of theme, like family names.” And get ready, folks. This is likely the first of many kids for the happy family. “I have loved having lots of brothers and sisters and although Derick comes from a family with just one brother, both of us would love to have as many children as God will give us,” Jill shared with Page Six. Congrats to the happy couple. Now let’s start shopping!</p><p><a href=#>[From E! News]</a></p><p>How common is it to put stuff like Gatorade and Purell on your baby registry? I really don’t know – I’ve never looked at a Walmart baby registry before today (I live a sheltered life, I know). If I was buying the gifts (and I AM NOT), I would just get them a gift certificate to Walmart and let them go wild with all of the Gatorade they could ever want (for the baby, obvs). Also: Walmart sells guns and I’m absolutely shocked that there are no weapons on the baby registry. You would think that a Duggar would have insisted on baby’s first shotgun.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/jill1.jpg alt=jill1 width=510 sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Instagram, Facebook.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbHFjaX16e8mio6WXlKq0qK3RrJawmZyirrPAvpuYm7GPp7KotdKtqbKXmaOwrcHDnqqYn5GpvLOtw56Wqa2imrmtq8yaop6rj6iyr7%2FEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
