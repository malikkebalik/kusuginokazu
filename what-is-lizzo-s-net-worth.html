I’m not ignorant to the fact that we had to have a demeanor of lowering ourselves culturally just to exist. But I’m trying to shake up the narrative about how we’re supposed to act.”<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/janelle-monae-lizzo.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She’s friends with ‘Boom Clap’ artist, Charli XCX</h2><p id=par-8_53>As if we didn’t need another reason to love Lizzo, she collaborated with British artist, Charli XCX.
