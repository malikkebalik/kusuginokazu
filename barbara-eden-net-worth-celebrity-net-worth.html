Eden is probably best known for her starring role in "I Dream of Jeannie." After studying theater in San Francisco and entering various beauty pageants, Barbara began her career with a wide range of television and film roles before landing her breakthrough role in "I Dream of Jeannie." After this show came to an end, she continued to book a wide range of additional roles throughout the years and appeared in a number of Broadway stage productions. Eden is also an established voice actor. In 2011, she released a memoir entitled "Jeannie Out of the Bottle." In 1988, Barbara Eden was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Barbara Jean Morehead was born on August 23rd of 1931 in Tucson, Arizona. Barbara's parents divorced when she was young, and she subsequently relocated to San Francisco with her mother, Alice. Barbara's mother then remarried and had another child, giving her a younger half-sister. Unfortunately, the Great Depression hit this family hard, and they lived on a shoestring budget. To entertain her children, Alice sang a variety of songs. This probably inspired Barbara to pursue singing herself.</p><p>Eden began by performing in the local church choir, and she was given solos. By the time she had become a teenager, she was earning decent money by singing in nightclubs. However, she also focused on a future acting career, becoming a member of Actor's Equity at the age of 16 and studying at the Elizabeth Holloway School of Theatre. She also studied singing at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music during this period. After graduating from high school in 1949, she studied theater for one year at the City College of San Francisco. During this time, she also entered various beauty pageants and was named Miss San Francisco in 1951. She then entered the Miss California Pageant.</p><h2 id=early-career><strong>Early Career</strong></h2><p>By 1955, Barbara had made her first television appearance on the "The <a href=# title="Johnny Carson Net Worth">Johnny Carson</a> Show."

She also gained recognition for her guest-starring role in four episodes of "Burke's Law," and she played different roles in each of these episodes. In 1957, she began starring in "How to Marry a Millionaire."</p><p>Her transition to film roles came after she was discovered by director Mark Robson, who saw her in a play alongside <a href=# title="James Drury Net Worth">James Drury</a>. Robson later organized a screen test for her with 20th Century Fox for the film "No Down Payment." Although she didn't land the role she was tested for, the studio offered her a contract.

The series was created to capitalize on the success of "Bewitched," which was just coming to a close in 1964. Sidney Sheldon wanted a similar show to continue that run of success, and Barbara Eden booked the role after a number of brunettes and beauty queens auditioned unsuccessfully. In this career-defining project, Eden played a beautiful genie that was set free by an astronaut. For the next five years, Barbara was primarily focused on this project, and she appeared in 139 episodes. During this period, she also played the genie's evil, brunette sister. In 1970, "I Dream of Jeannie" came to an end.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-328760 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Barbara-Eden.jpg alt="Barbara Eden Net Worth" width=813 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 813px) 100vw, 813px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-328760 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=after-jeannie><strong>After Jeannie</strong></h2><p>Following the end of this show, Barbara continued to be a major player in Hollywood.
