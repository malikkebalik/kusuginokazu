Early previews of the show prove the two are close, though Crumpler already had <a href=#>weight loss surgery</a> and Cross has not. So, where do the best friends live?</p><p id=par-3_80>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cinemaholic</a>, Cross lives in or around Atlanta, Georgia. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanessa Cross’s Instagram</a> shows a number of posts where she’s in Atlanta — and one from November 2021 suggests she lives there or close by. “This journey isn’t going to be easy, but I know I can do it!” she captioned a post of herself throwing up a peace sign while outdoors. She tagged the location as Atlanta, Georgia, and she also tagged the location in her post.</p><p id=par-4_43>As for Crumpler, she reportedly lives in Hoschton, Georgia, and she’s from Stockbridge, Georgia. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan Crumpler’s Instagram</a> also features photos and videos of her in this location and in Atlanta. It takes about an hour by car to travel from Atlanta to Hoschton.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meghan Crumpler says she lives in her friend’s basement — and the friend is also featured on ‘1000-lb Best Friends’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_44>Meghan Crumpler shared more information about her living situation. She spoke to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV Insider</a> about 1000-lb Best Friends, and she divulged that she lives in Tina Arnold’s basement apartment. Arnold is another one of the friends featured on the show, as is Ashley Sutton.</p><p id=par-6_74>“Well, I actually live with Tina in her basement, so we share quite a bit,” Crumpler said in her interview. “I would say the show does feature me and Vannessa because we were on&nbsp;Too Large&nbsp;together, but I would definitely say that Tina and Ashley both are just as amazing as we are, and I think you’ll find that out once you get to see the whole thing unfold. And they’re just amazing women, period.”</p><p id=par-7_34>Jon, Crumpler’s boyfriend while filming Too Large, proposed to her during the show. It’s unclear what their relationship is like now with 1000-lb Best Friends, but they currently don’t seem to live together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When does ‘1000-lb Best Friends’ air?
