According to its findings, Dobrev earned $40,000 per episode when she left the series. (It is unclear how much she made when it debuted.)&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_40>Her pay did not consider the other characters she embodied.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dobrev also played Katherine Pierce</a>/Katerina Petrova — Elena’s doppelganger and a recurring villain. Additionally, she portrayed Amara, the world’s first immortal woman and progenitor of the Petrova doppelgangers, for three episodes.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_47>Even if Nina Dobrev wasn’t paid more for playing three distinct characters&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Orphan Black-style</a>, her&nbsp;The Vampire Diaries&nbsp;salary still gave her quite a nest egg. It’s unclear when $40,000 became her standard pay. But assuming she made it for at least three seasons, she took home approximately $2.68 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-her-salary-was-in-line-with-the-rest-of-her-co-stars>Her salary was in line with the rest of her co-stars</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_32>Dobrev’s salary was in line with the other main stars of&nbsp;The Vampire Diaries.&nbsp;Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley were also paid an estimated $40,000 per episode as the Salvatore brothers, Damon and Stefan.</p><p id=par-7_51>Important supporting characters made comparable amounts.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kat Graham, whose Bonnie Bennett</a>&nbsp;moved up to leading character status after Dobrev left, earned $35,000 for the final season.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Candice King</a>, who portrayed Elena and Bonnie’s best friend Caroline Forbes, never made her salary public. But Screenrant estimates it likely fell in the $30,000 to $40,000 range.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_24>Supporting actor salaries landed on the lower end of the scale. Steven R.

Wesley comes in at No. 3, with $6 million (according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>). As his only leading role since the series is the CBS All Access show&nbsp;Tell Me a Story, this makes sense.</p><p id=par-10_42>Dobrev falls in between her two male co-stars.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>&nbsp;estimates she’s worth approximately $11 million. Aside from the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">short-lived sitcom&nbsp;Fam</a>, the actor has almost entirely transitioned into film, from action thrillers like XXX: Return of Xander Cage to romantic comedies such as&nbsp;Love Hard.</p><p id=par-11_60>Finally, Somerhalder paces just ahead of his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ex-girlfriend Dobrev</a>. He is worth $12 million, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. A portion of this likely comes from his time on the hit series,&nbsp;Lost.
