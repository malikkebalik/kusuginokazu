Leonardo DiCaprio has a net worth of $300 million. In the 25 years between 1995 and 2020 alone, Leonardo DiCaprio earned north of $300 million from salaries and backend points alone. For example, though he earned just $2.5 million in base salary from 1997's Titanic, he eventually earned $40 million thanks to 1.8% cut of gross backend points. He has also earned additional tens of millions from endorsements, real estate investments and venture capital stakes.</p><p>The Oscar-winning and star of such films as "This Boy's Life", "What's Eating Gilbert Grape", "The Basketball Diaries", "Romeo + Juliet", "Titanic", "Catch Me If You Can", "The Aviator", "The Departed", "Revolutionary Road", "Inception", "The Revenant" and "The Wolf of Wall Street," began his acting career 30 years ago, when he was booted from the cast of "Romper Stomper" for being too rambunctious. Luckily, that slightly inauspicious beginning did not deter him from pursuing a career in acting, and as a young teen, he worked steadily, appearing in commercials and in guest starring roles on various television shows. He began to attract more attention after being cast in a recurring role on "Growing Pains", and then officially broke out with his critically acclaimed performance in the film, "This Boy's Life" in 1992. Since then, he has quite literally never stopped working and is always involved in a new project, whether as an actor or producer.</p>Key Facts<ul><li>Made $300 million from film salaries between 1995 and 2020</li><li>Has earned at least $100 million from endorsements</li><li>Backend points on Titanic resulted in a $40 million payday</li><li>Has donated and/or raised more than $80 million for charity</li><li>Owns $100 million worth of real estate</li><li>Owns a 104 acre private island in Belize</li></ul><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-343400 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Leonardo.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1512px) 100vw, 1512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-343400 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty Images)</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Leonardo got his start in Hollywood by appearing in a smattering of commercials and television roles as a child.

More specifically, "to help promote and sustain the long-term vitality of all of the Earth's inhabitants."
