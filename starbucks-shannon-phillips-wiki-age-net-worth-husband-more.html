</strong><strong>Shannon Phillips</strong></h2><p>Shannon Phillips <strong>(age: 52, born in 1971), </strong>a business executive currently working as the Regional Director of Sales at Raymour & Flanigan Furniture and Mattresses, recently made headlines with her groundbreaking victory against racism.</p><p>Phillips, who had served as a Regional Director at Starbucks for 12.5 years, was terminated in May 2018 following a highly publicized incident involving two African-American men, Rashon Nelson, and Donte Robinson.</p><p>In 2019, she filed a lawsuit against Starbucks, claiming that her termination resulted from racial discrimination. In June 2023, a jury ruled in favor of Phillips, awarding her $25 million as punitive damages and $600,000 as compensatory damages.<strong><br></strong></p><p><img decoding=async title="Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Rashon-Nelson-and-Donte-Robinson.webp alt="Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson" width=500 height=327 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Why Shannon Phillips Received $25.6 Million From Starbucks?</strong></h2><p>In April 2018, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson found themselves handcuffed by Philadelphia Police officers after a Starbucks store manager called 911.</p><p>The two men were waiting inside the store to meet a business partner when the manager asked them to either make a purchase or leave the premises.</p><p>Shannon’s lawsuit against Starbucks claimed that racial discrimination significantly affected her termination. She argued that Starbucks took steps to punish white employees who had no involvement in the incident to project an image of proper response to the community.</p><p>Phillips alleged that she was instructed to place a white employee on administrative leave based on a false allegation of discriminatory conduct. She provided evidence to prove the allegation was factually impossible.</p><p>Shannon defended herself by voicing objections to the punishment of a Philadelphia district manager who non-white managers had accused of paying them less than white employees.</p><p>She emphasized that the district manager had no history of discriminatory behavior and had no influence over employee salaries. Starbucks’ compensation policies were in place to determine employee compensation, not individual managers.</p><p>The lawsuit also highlighted the disparity in how Starbucks handled the incident. While Phillips faced termination, the black district manager overseeing the Philadelphia store where the arrests occurred received no punishment.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Shannon Phillips who sued Starbucks for $25 million" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shannon-Phillips-who-sued-Starbucks-for-25-million.webp alt="Shannon Phillips who sued Starbucks for $25 million" width=500 height=486 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Shannon Phillips: Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Shannon Phillips was born in 1971 in Columbus, Ohio, America.
