The pair discusses relationships, addiction, celebrity status, mental health, and everything in between.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>One of the youngest SNL cast members ever, Davidson is the first addition to the storied group to have been born in the 1990s, joining back in 2014 when he was a mere 20 years old. <a href=#>Here’s</a> a list of the top 10 youngest celebrities to ever appear on Saturday Night Live.</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>Davidson is perhaps one of the most grounded and down-to-earth entertainers currently working, never missing an opportunity to share his darkly comedic perspective on just about anything. Take a look at the video below, showing some of his most “savage” moments.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>It isn’t just his worldview that captivates audiences. Davidson also falls into an oddly specific role on the late night variety show that kickstarted his career. Known far and wide for his perfectly-timed (or imperfectly-timed, depending on how you view them) character breaks, Davidson constantly struggles to keep a straight face throughout the weekly sketches he participates in.</p><p data-characters=82 data-current-count=82 data-injectable=false>Watch the hilarious supercut below to see some of his more memorable breaks.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true>With such an early start in show business, it’s normal to wonder how much the now 27-year-old comedian, writer, and producer is worth.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Davidson has a small fortune somewhere in the vicinity of $8 million dollars. He’s worth far more than fellow SNL cast members Mikey Day and Sasheer Zamata, and even comes close to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">net worth of Kate McKinnon</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Featuring-Pete-Davidson-advertisement-in-Taco-Bell-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pete-davidson-colin-jost-snl.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image_2022-09-21_131941356.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Hellmans-super-bowl-commercial_.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chase-sui-wonders-pete-davidson.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Pete-Davidson-Manscaped-WilliePetersen.jpg><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true>Having that kind of money to throw around seems like it makes for a pretty comfortable lifestyle, and for the most part, that appears to be the case for Davidson. However, when it comes to paying for a friend’s birthday dinner, anything can happen, especially when that friend is Kid Cudi and Kanye West shows up to join in on the celebration.</p><p data-characters=139 data-current-count=139 data-injectable=false>In a stint on The Tonight Show, Davidson shared his story about dining with the famous rappers and how he got stuck footing the bill.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>Over the years, Pete Davidson has been known to shift his style often and without warning. He suffers from borderline personality disorder and his battle is a constant one, but it never seems to slow him down.
