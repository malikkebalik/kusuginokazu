The photo featured a unusual dig at Beijing.</p><p>At first glance, the picture may look somewhat routine, but a small, albeit very noticeable, patch on one pilot's arm shows Winnie the Pooh getting punched in the face by a bear — a not-so-subtle jab at Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p><p>On the patch, Winnie the Pooh — who is holding a pot of honey with five stars like the Chinese flag — is being punched by an angry Formosan black bear holding Taiwan's flag. Above that image, text reads "We are open 24/7," and below it, the text says "Scramble!"&nbsp;</p><p>The unofficial air force patch is a variation of a years-long meme involving the cartoon created by the English author A. A. Milne.&nbsp;</p><p>Advertisement</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Crew members of Taiwanese Air Force inspect an aircraft during a military exercise, at an undisclosed location in Taiwan in this handout picture provided by Taiwan Defence Ministry and released on April 9, 2023. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Taiwan Defence Ministry/Handout via REUTERS</span></span></figure><p>Imagines of Winnie the Pooh have been <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>circulating</a> around Western and Chinese social media as a meme for nearly a decade. The cartoon is used by critics of Xi in a derogatory sense, the joke being that the Chinese leader somewhat resembles the fictional teddy bear in appearance. Chinese sensors have in the past made attempts to shut down circulation of the meme, even going as far as to scrub social media sites of negative discussion about Xi.&nbsp;</p><p>The specific patches worn by the Taiwanese fighter pilots represent a symbol of defiance from the self-ruling democratic island against neighboring China, with the phrase "Scramble" <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>referring</a> to the deployment of jets against routine Chinese incursions into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone.&nbsp;</p><p>Patch designer Alec Hsu <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>told</a> Reuters he started selling the item at his shop in 2022 but saw a marked increase in orders after Taiwan's military published the photos over the weekend. "I wanted to boost the morale of our troops through designing this patch," he said. It's been purchased by military personnel and civilians alike.</p><p>"Where can we get a patch like that! Guaranteed to be best sellers!" Taiwan's main representative office in the US <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>wrote</a> Sunday on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>Advertisement</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>This picture shows patches depicting a Formosan black bear holding a Taiwanese flag punching Winnie-the-Pooh at a shop in Taoyuan on April 11, 2023. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Photo by SAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images</span></span></figure><p>Tensions between Taiwan and China have been running high in recent days following a trip last week by Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen to the US, where she met with lawmakers, including House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.&nbsp;</p><p>Her visit stoked ire in Beijing, with China's defense ministry <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>calling</a> it "provocative." In response, China on Saturday began three days of <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>military drills</a> that included the encirclement of Taiwan and involved Chinese fighter jets, missile boats, naval destroyers, long-range rocket artillery, bombers, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command even shared a <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>video examining</a> how a full-scale assault against Taiwan would play out, showing possible missile trajectories coming from the Chinese mainland and warships.&nbsp;Beijing's defense ministry <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>said</a> the war games — dubbed "Joint Sword" — are meant to be a "stern warning" to Taiwan, which sharply criticized the exercises.&nbsp;</p><p>"We condemn such an irrational act that has jeopardized regional security and stability. #ROCArmedForces have monitored the situation and tasked CAP aircraft, Navy vessels, and land-based missile systems to respond these activities," Taiwan's defense ministry wrote in a <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>statement</a> posted to social media.&nbsp;</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>China has long considered Taiwan to be an inseparable part of its own territory, and Beijing has in recent years <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>intensified</a> its military pressure on the small island of 23 million people. Experts have <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>said</a> that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would plunge the world economy into chaos and devastate all militaries involved.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufony1rciwmKdloJ65sMCMnJirrJ%2Bku268zqifZqiRqbCpecCipJ6cXZbBbq%2FHoqWaZaieequ1zamgp59dZ31zf4xt</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
