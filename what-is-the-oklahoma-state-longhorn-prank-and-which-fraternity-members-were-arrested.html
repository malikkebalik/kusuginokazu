More than a month later, four members of OSU’s Alpha Gamma Rho frat chapter were arrested for the gruesome prank.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=571 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Austin-American Statesman</a>, the FarmHouse fraternity suspected right away who was responsible for the dead animal they discovered in front of their off-campus frat house on Dec. 1. There had been an ongoing “prank war” between the two frat houses at the same university. The students assumed this was just the latest attack. Police questioned members of Alpha Gamma Rho frat about what happened, but “there was a significant amount of collective lack of cooperation from the Alpha Gamma Rho organization,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a police affidavit said</a>.</p><p data-characters=587 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true>Meanwhile, TJ Low, a Stillwater, Oklahoma police spokesperson, told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Oklahoman</a>, “We’ve never had anything like this within our jurisdiction. It’s a very cruel crime to be committed, especially right before the Big 12 Championship.” According to a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stillwater police statement</a>, where Oklahoma State University is located, “The heinous nature of how the animal carcass was disposed is unlawful.” The steer has its abdomen cut and an expletive targeted at the FarmHouse frat branded on its side. It was later determined the animal died from a disease.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bennett-fady-luke-ackerley-brody-shelby-and-andrew-king-were-arrested data-injectable=false>Bennett Fady, Luke Ackerley, Brody Shelby, and Andrew King were arrested</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>via KENS 4 News/YouTube</figure><p data-characters=563 data-current-count=863 data-injectable=true>On Jan 22, 2024, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC News</a> reported that four members of the Alpha Gamma Rho frat named Bennett Fady, Luke Ackerley, Brody Shelby, and Andrew King, were arrested for the grim Longhorn steer prank and charged with unlawful disposal of a carcass, a misdemeanor. The four men, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">identified through a search warrant</a>, used a truck or trailer to transport the dead animal to the frat house and then dump it on the lawn. According to an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oklahoma</a> news outlet, <a href=#>KFOR.com</a>, the frat members were released on their own recognizance and expected to appear in court in March 2024.</p><p data-characters=69 data-current-count=69 data-injectable=false>In response to what happened, OSU representatives wrote on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>,</p><p>“Oklahoma State University is appalled at the disturbing display of animal cruelty that occurred overnight at an off-campus location near a fraternity house.

Texas’s mascot is a Longhorn steer, but the incident seemed to have no direct connection to the Austin, Texas, school.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6y1osCMoqpmrJiaerC3y5qfqKWRYsC1rdOeZKWnnpy1sL7NZqermZ6geqK6w2auoaGTnXqnvsCtnKummanGbrnEppmeqqNixKa%2BxGaYq6qVqMGmsI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
