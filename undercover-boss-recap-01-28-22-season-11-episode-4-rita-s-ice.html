Linda Chadwick was one the bosses that started out in fast food service and so she knows that some businesses rely on good service to grow. The business became a franchise back in 1989. It has had some setbacks. It could be because of the pandemic and it could also be because someone or several people have forgotten the spirit of Rita’s.</p><p>Rita’s was opened by a man selling his mother’s shaved ice recipes on his stoop. It was in the original Rita’s name that the company expanded and continued to create a name for its. Chadwick wants to make the company a household name across the United States. But to do that, she needs to find out what needs improvement.</p><p>Linda dressed up in an outfit. She pretended to be a former teacher looking to start over and is doing so for a documentary. Hence the cameras following her around. Linda also did her best to relearn on the job and her first job undercover was with franchise owner Hezron. Hezron was new to the company. He bought his franchise two years ago while that building has actually been a part of the franchise for almost twenty years. Linda went in with no expectations. She quickly noticed the curb appeal of the building because it did look great from the outside. What wasn’t so great was the old fashion credit card system.</p><p>Everything was going great while people were paying with cash. It stopped doing so well once Linda had to use the first credit card payment. The system that Hezron has was so outdated that it needed dial-up. Hezron said that while buying into the franchise is great – it doesn’t help with the everyday costs that build up. He had an outdated credit system. He even had an outdated outside cart. It was quite small and it could only be stocked to a certain point. Hezron usually doesn’t stay outside with the cart more than two hours. But as bad as things were with him, Linda could still respect him and what he has done with his franchise.</p><p>Linda couldn’t do that with Stefani. Stefani was told that Linda was looking to buy a franchise and that she wanted to learn from her. Only Stefani did everything wrong. Stefani owns the franchise. She decided to ignore the company policy of opening at twelve so that she can open at two. She did so because she has small kids and her youngest was in fact five months old. The kids were also at the franchise. They were running around. They were being adorable but a nuisance. Stefani also had a new drive through that was quite dangerous. It was located across a busy street. And the drivers had to cross it to pick up their orders at the window.</p><p>There was no sign out there. There was nothing out there to assist customers and after several false starts with their new intercom – Linda finally had enough. She unmasked herself. She revealed she was the CEO and she also told Stefani that they were going to have to talk about this. Stefani didn’t leave a good impression but Linda was also hoping her next franchise owner would be different. Andrew was a nice guy. He opened his business in Florida where Linda was hoping to expand their market overall and he showed her something that the company needed to work on. Their ordering system was out of date. Andrew had to create his own that was much simpler.</p><p>Andrew also had a hiring initiative that Linda took inspiration from. Andrew was engaged to a wonderful man who happens to be on the spectrum and so he strove to hire others on the spectrum. Linda met Pastiche. Pastiche works for Andrew. She’s also great at her job and is an amazing artist. She creates drawings for the kids to color in and they hang it up at the store. Linda’s biggest challenge is recruitment and so she knows now how much the others have to be encouraged to be inclusive. They could be missing out by not doing so. Andrew was a great boss and Linda felt a lot of the other franchise owners can learn from him.</p><p>Later, Linda unmasked herself to the others. She gave Hezron a Rita’s ice cream truck that means his business will no longer have to use that tiny cart anymore and she even gave him ten grand for his family to take a vacation. But Linda also had to deal with Stefani. Stefani’s drive thru had to be shut down while Linda was there. Linda has since realized that Stefani just needed a cash influx to fix the problems and so she was giving her twenty-five grand as well as free mentoring so that Stefani can finally get the help she needs. And Linda also gave Linda the idea to create a diversity initiative within the company.</p><p>Lina managed to fix the ordering system as well before she handed over money to Andrew. He can no go on that honeymoon of his without worrying about how to afford it.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWtnpaOxpr7CqK2eql2XvLS%2FjKucnJmgYn1yeZFxZGtqXaiyor%2FOp2RqaV2avaq%2Fzp2cZmxdp7a1rdJmoJydXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
