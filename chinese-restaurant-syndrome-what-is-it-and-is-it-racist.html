The US Food and Drug Administration has long approved MSG for consumption, and studies have failed to show that the chemical causes the alleged "syndrome".</p><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">What's the science behind MSG?</h2><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The flavour enhancer works when molecules of MSG bind to receptors on the tongue that naturally sense the key flavour chemical it contains - glutamate.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Glutamate is a compound naturally found in foods from breast milk to parmesan cheese.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">MSG was patented in 1909 by the Japanese chemist Kikunae Ikeda, who gave his invention the name "the essence of taste" and described its ineffable flavour as "umami", now recognised as one of the five basic flavours.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Although anecdotal claims that MSG has adverse effects have proliferated since the mid-20th Century, no studies have established any accepted mechanism for harm.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">A 2019 review of scientific literature in the journal Food Science and Food Safety concluded that claims linking MSG to an assortment of ailments were unsubstantiated.</p><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">Words and meanings</h2><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The comedian and chef Eddie Huang and the TV host Jeannie Mai were recruited to bolster the MSG's cause.</p><h4 class="sc-d8a1d567-2 dNWcPM">Allow Twitter content?</h4>This article contains content provided by Twitter.
