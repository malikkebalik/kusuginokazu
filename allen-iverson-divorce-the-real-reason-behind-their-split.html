Iverson was born on June 7th, 1975, in Hampton, in the Commonwealth of Virginia. It didn’t take long for him to establish himself as one of history’s most dynamic and well-known NBA players.</p><p>His abilities, athleticism, and ferocious competition challenged standards and smashed prejudices, even though he was barely 6 feet tall. Iverson’s hypnotic crossover dribble, lightning-fast speed, and uncanny ability to score against tall opponents made him a nightmare for defenders to deal with during his time on the court. As in the below article, we will discuss Allen Iverson’s divorce and many other things.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/allen-iverson-divorce.jpg><h2>Reason Behind Allen Iverson’s Divorce</h2><p>The marriage of Turner and her husband appeared thriving from the outside looking in, but things were very different. In 2002, he drove his nude wife out of the house due to an argument with her. After then, it is said that he used a gun to threaten his cousin.</p><p>Similarly, the circumstance deteriorated, and Tawanna could no longer maintain her composure. In 2009, she submitted a divorce petition. Tawanna claimed in the divorce documents that Iverson had blown through $150 million gambling and drinking and that the couple had racked up a significant amount of debt.</p><p><strong>A tweet by Legion Hoops in which it mentions that Allen Iverson will go to jail today if he doesn’t pay his ex-wife the divorce settlement amount of $71,000:</strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Allen Iverson will go to jail today if he doesn’t pay his ex-wife $71,000 in child support.</p><p>— Legion Hoops (@LegionHoops) <a href=# rel=noopener>June 24, 2013</a></p><p>Iverson had a habit of spending $36,000 monthly, even though his income was barely a sixth of that amount. However, Tawanna did return the divorce papers after Iverson begged and pleaded with her to do so. After a few months, she revoked the divorce papers and filed for divorce again, which kicked off the legal struggle in 2013. They were able to finalize their divorce in January 2013.</p><p><strong>We previously wrote some articles about divorced celebrities.
