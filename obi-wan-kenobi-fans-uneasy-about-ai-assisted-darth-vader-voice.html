However, when fans scrutinized the credits of the episode, they discovered Respeecher was credited for ‚ÄúVoice Conversion Services.‚Äù</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=658 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>So apparently James Earl Jones didn‚Äôt record voice lines for <a href=#>#ObiWanKenobi</a> and instead Disney used the same AI voice technology for Vader‚Äôs voice as they did for Luke in The Book of Boba Fett. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/tbJtawVGh8</a></p>‚Äî Ollie üèπ (@TheQuiver_) <a href=#>June 3, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>This led some fans to believe that perhaps Jones didn‚Äôt do any voice acting work at all for the TV show, but that instead, his performances were generated from scratch using a computer. That was a prospect one Twitter called ‚ÄúUtterly horrifying‚Äù and ‚ÄúJust pure cyberpunk dystopia hell.‚Äù</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Vader's voice in Obi-Wan being credited to James Earl Jones but actually being composed of an AI generated version of his voice from hours of footage with JEJ not actually recording a second of new dialogue is</p><p>Utterly horrifying</p><p>Just pure cyberpunk dystopia hell</p>‚Äî The Italian Misato Katsuragi (@Blankzilla) <a href=#>June 3, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>However, there is not really any hard evidence to support that Jones didn‚Äôt do any voice acting himself. While his audio likeness being generated solely from a computer is still a possibility, as Disney has not gone into details about how the cameo came to be, the same technology was used before in The Book of Boba Fett for Mark Hamill‚Äôs reprisal as a digitally de-aged Luke Skywalker.</p><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=726 data-injectable=true>As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cinemablend</a> pointed out, it‚Äôs entirely possible ‚Äúthat the Respeecher tech could have been used to simply augment dialogue Jones recorded specifically for Obi-Wan Kenobi to make the character sound more like he would a little under a decade before the events of A New Hope, when he‚Äôs not as fully formed.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=158 data-current-count=158 data-injectable=false>For one Twitter user, they saw no difference between using AI to assist a voice performance and using makeup to alter an actor‚Äôs look in a film or play.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is literally no different than putting makeup on an actor, or changing their look somehow to make them appear younger when the story calls for it. Movies and stage productions have been doing this for decades. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hjInZuLN0x</a></p>‚Äî Eric (@Chaotician96) <a href=#>June 3, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=128 data-injectable=false>Another fan disagreed, saying the AI could rob an actor of properly conveying their intended inflection and tone in their voice.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>lmao you donut, it‚Äôs robbing an actor of a performance and their voice inflection and tone. Vader sounds awful when his voice is copy/pasted using the same pool of quotes. Look how unnaturally the voice leaps in pitch when they mash it up.

Soon, there may be a time when actors won‚Äôt even be required to portray characters in our favorite movies or TV shows.
