He spent his childhood with his three adorable siblings under the observation of affectionate parents. The names of his siblings are Tyede, Steele, and Sage. The young artist belongs to the Jewish religion just like his father, who was born to a diehard Jewish family. Sivan’s mother converted to Judaism after getting inspired.

He kept studying there until 2009 when he completely switched to distant learning.</p><h2 id=tableofcontents2>Music Career</h2><figure class=instagram><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>SHANGHAI by @joachimjohnson.
