That being said, the 90 Day Fiancé Tell All has been a chance for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">both sides to air grievances</a>. And while Mike Youngquist tried to garner sympathy by mentioning that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Natalie Mordovtseva uses his bank card</a>, Natalie had a secret weapon — apparently, she found nudes on Mike’s phone after the couple got engaged. Now, fans feel like Mike’s story doesn’t add up, and they’re blasting Trish for her comments.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-natalie-mordovtseva-says-she-found-nudes>Natalie Mordovtseva says she found nudes</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-2_30>90 Day Fiancé star Natalie Mordovtseva has brought up Mike Youngquist’s naughty photos before. Specifically, during Mike’s birthday dinner, Natalie mentioned that one of his friends kept sending him nudes.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_26>Mike stood up to leave, indicating it was clearly a sensitive subject. He left Natalie at the hotel, saying he would head home and take shots.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_18>“What is the reason to stand up and leave if you have nothing to hide?” Natalie asked him.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_49>&nbsp;“Michael said that he would like me to be not that aggressive towards his friends and I ask him, could you please not send them naked pictures? A girl from Nevada. He said she’s his friend but she kept sending him her boobs,” Natalie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told producers at the time</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_41>During the Tell All episode, Trish brought up their “terrible” Paris trip, which surprised Natalie — she didn’t think it had been that bad. Mike said they had a lot of big fights, and Natalie claimed it was due to nudes.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_34>“Because I found naked boobs on his phone,” Natalie replied. She suggested this happened mere hours after their engagement. Natalie claims she found the photos while scrolling through his phone, including his deleted photos.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-90-day-fianc-fans-don-t-think-mike-s-story-adds-up>‘90 Day Fiancé’ fans don’t think Mike’s story adds up</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mike-and-Natalie-on-90-Day-Fianc%C3%A9-1-1024x683.jpg><p id=par-8_35>90 Day Fiancé fans aren’t entirely convinced that Mike Youngquist wasn’t up to no good. Mike claimed that he’d been sent the photos and deleted them previously and that Natalie looked into his deleted files.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_44>“And first thing what I see is this lady, and I see of course the date. It was one week before he arrived,” Natalie claimed. Fans were with Natalie on this, many suspected that Mike had saved the photos and had been keeping them.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_36>“No he definitely was talking to his ex and saved those [photos] and then deleted them when he went to see Natalie.
