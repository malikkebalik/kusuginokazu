In a 1999 interview, following the airing of the E! True Hollywood Story about Wilsey's life and death, Fine commented: "We had an ongoing, on-again, off-again, volatile, loving relationship. At that time I was having a lot of problems myself. Between [male porn actor] Sikki Nixx and Savannah pushing and pulling, I pretty much at one point ran away from them both. I couldn't take it any longer. But I feel I left her behind when she needed me most. It's very sad."</p><p>Even after her death, Wilsey continued to appear via archival footage. She appeared as Santana on Joe Bob's Drive-In Theater when the show aired Sorority House Massacre II (October 1994).</p><p>Wilsey committed suicide in 1994 by shooting herself after a car accident. On the evening of July 11, Wilsey was involved in an auto accident with her Corvette in which she reportedly broke her nose and injured her face. Upset over the accident, she went home to Universal City, asked a friend to walk her dog, and then called her manager, Nancy Pera. It was Pera who later discovered Wilsey in the garage of Wilsey's home.</p><p>Wilsey was introduced to the adult film industry by actor and director Rex Cabo. She started out at first in photo spreads for Cheri, Hustler, Swank, and Penthouse magazines, and then she signed an exclusive contract with Vivid Entertainment in 1991 and became one of the earliest Vivid Girls. Wilsey began using drugs and spending large amounts of money, and she reportedly had severe financial troubles despite her substantial income. She also garnered a reputation for arriving late to film shoots, being temperamental and acting like a diva, and sometimes getting drunk or abusing drugs on the said sets of the film/video shoots these antics eventually led to Vivid severing its association with her in 1993. She ended her career by mainly freelancing for lower budget porn companies by capitalizing on her still big but clearly fading name in the industry.</p><p>She also had a credit for her performance on a soundtrack in the video The Spectacle (1991).</p><p>Wilsey also appeared in a variety of minor roles in B movies (mostly comedy, horror and/or sci-fi) in which she was credited with her real name. These roles included The Invisible Maniac (1990) and Camp Fear (1991).</p><p>Wilsey reportedly took her stage name from Savannah Smiles (1982), a movie she enjoyed. She died in 1994, after being taken to the hospital following a suicide attempt by firearm.</p><p>Shannon Michelle Wilsey (October 9, 1970 – July 11, 1994), better known by her stage name Savannah, was an American pornographic film actress who starred in over 100 videos during her career.
