According to this view, Jehovah’s Witnesses can be traced back to the 1872 founding of the International Association of Bible Students in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In contrast, the Bible Student association began sending missionaries abroad in 1881, with the first overseas branch establishing itself in London in the year 1900.</p><p>Additionally, the group disbanded into different rivals in 1916 after Russell’s death. Rutherford’s faction was one of those in competition for the Watch Tower’s leadership. Furthermore, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society remained under this group’s control. To fulfil his need for a publishing house, Russell established the Watch Tower Society.</p><p>They insist that the God they call Jehovah is the greatest. However, Jesus Christ is seen by Jehovah’s Witnesses as a mediator between God and humanity. As the name for God’s dynamic force in the cosmos, “Holy Spirit” has come to be universally accepted. They dedicate their devotion to Jehovah. The Jehovah’s Witnesses live in buildings called kingdom halls.</p><p>The Witnesses also think that Jehovah made everything. <strong>They also ignore important dates like birthdays and national holidays.</strong> The time between Passover and Easter is significant for Jehovah’s Witnesses because it marks the day Jesus Christ died.</p><p><strong>You can also read about these recent reports:</strong></p><h2><strong>Do Jehovah Witnesses Celebrate Thanksgiving?</strong></h2><p>Holidays aren’t a big deal to Jehovah’s Witnesses. <strong>Most holidays and other events that honor people other than Jesus are not observed by Jehovah’s Witnesses.</strong> Holidays like Halloween, Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day are included in this category as well.</p><p>They also don’t observe Christian holidays like Christmas and Easter because they think those celebrations have heathen roots. Because there is no evidence that Jesus was born on December 25 and because many Christmas traditions, such as decorating a tree with lights and exchanging gifts with family and friends have pagan origins, the group asserts that Christmas is not approved by God.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Do-Jehovah-Witnesses-Celebrate-Thanksgiving-3.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Thanksgiving</a> is not a holiday observed by Jehovah’s Witnesses.</strong> They use the time to do more door-to-door evangelism instead. According to the reports, an elder at a Kingdom Hall in <a href=# rel=noopener>Jackson Heights</a>, Queens, since it’s a holiday from the secular viewpoint people have time off so usually, families and individuals will put forth extra effort in the ministry to go door to door.</p><p>He claimed that during the holidays there was a dramatic increase in the number of witnesses from his church who canvassed the city. He further explained that eight to ten people would typically participate in the service during the week. But on holidays, it can easily double to 40. The Jackson Heights church’s witnesses cover 80 territories in Jackson Heights and Astoria. Three to four individual blocks make up each territory.</p><p>It is not in the practice of Jehovah’s Witnesses to mark the holidays or birthdays of other faiths or nations.<a href=# rel=noopener> Jesus Christ</a>‘s death which occurs around the time of Easter and Passover is the only holiday observed by these people.</p><h2><strong>What are the things that you don’t know about Jehovah’s Witnesses?</strong></h2><p><strong>These are one of the wealthiest and least open organizations in all of Canada. </strong>As a tax-exempt religious group, Jehovah’s Witnesses don’t have to worry about paying payroll or corporate taxes. With over $80 million in donations in 2016, they ranked 18 out of Canada’s 86,000 registered charities.</p><p>Because they do not disclose how donor money is actually used, Charity Intelligence, a group that evaluates charities for Canadian givers, gives the organization a failing grade. Out of a possible five stars, Jehovah’s Witnesses only get one. That ought to raise a red flag with potential backers. And that ought to serve as a warning sign to the government.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Do-Jehovah-Witnesses-Celebrate-Thanksgiving-2.jpg><p>They have no respect for the armed forces, the national anthem or the democratic process. Members of the Jehovah’s Witness faith do not participate in secular politics or military service because they believe that their allegiance should be sole to God who they believe rules the heavenly realm.</p><p>They refuse to get transfused with blood. The refusal of transfusions by Jehovah’s Witnesses is justified, they say by both the Old and New Testaments. To abstain from blood is in their minds doing what God wants. In a statement on its website, the group says, “We avoid taking blood not only in obedience to God but also out of respect for him as the Giver of life.”</p><h2><strong>Does Jehovah Witness Celebrate any Holiday?</strong></h2><p>In addition to birthdays and anniversaries, the Witnesses also observe the Memorial of Christ’s Death. During the Jewish holiday of Passover, Christians observe the memorial of Christ’s death. Since Jesus himself participated in it and instructed his followers to observe the day, it is generally accepted by members of this sect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Do-Jehovah-Witnesses-Celebrate-Thanksgiving-1.jpg><p><strong>Jehovah’s Witnesses don’t partake in the <a href=# rel=noopener>Christmas</a> holiday.</strong> This is due to the fact that some people contend Jesus never intended for his followers to celebrate his birthday. Christmas is a Christian holiday that is observed on December 25 each year. Christ’s birth is celebrated with this meal.</p><p><strong>You can read about these latest news topics also:</strong></p><p><strong>Jehovah’s Witnesses don’t celebrate holidays because they think doing so goes against God’s will.</strong> As a result, some Jehovah’s Witnesses consider those celebrations to be false representations of Christianity. When deciding if a holiday is appropriate, Jehovah’s Witnesses look to the Bible. For the same reason, Jehovah’s Witnesses don’t participate in holiday celebrations.</p><p><strong>Final Lines</strong></p><p>Visit us at <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>venturejolt.com</strong></a> to learn all the most recent information.
