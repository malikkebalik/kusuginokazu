If you want to call it messy go ahead, but where is the lie?” she explained. “Where did I lie? And if I said something, did I say it to their face? So I feel like ‘messy’ is sneaky, conniving, whispering. That’s my take of messy. I’m just like, ‘okay, you said that, yeah I said you said it, aight cool, let’s keep it moving.’”</p><p id=par-7_74>She explained why she took a step back from the show. “I didn’t want my baby to be petty,’ she said. “So in my mind, if I wasn’t petty when I was pregnant, then it wouldn’t go into her bloodstream and she would come out not petty.” However, she said that she thinks her daughter is petty just like she is. “What is she? Petty!
