The acclaimed biographical film earned the actor her first Academy Award nomination. But when she was first cast, not everyone could see her as the late Princess Di. That’s partly because she gained early fame as a brunette in <a href=#>the&nbsp;Twilight&nbsp;franchise</a>.</p><p id=par-2_25>However, since the popular fantasy films debuted, Stewart has sported various hairstyles for different roles. Here’s a look at the times Stewart has gone blonde.</p><h2 id=h-kristen-stewart-s-blonde-princess-diana-wig-was-surprisingly-critical-to-spencer-production>Kristen Stewart’s blonde Princess Diana wig was surprisingly critical to ‘Spencer’ production</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kristen-stewart-blonde-spencer.jpg><p id=par-3_63>Unlike the movies that made her a star,&nbsp;Spencer&nbsp;was a tightly focused indie from director Pablo Larraín (Jackie). Due to a limited budget and speedy production schedule,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stewart wore a wig</a>. She acknowledged there wasn’t time for her to go blonde. As she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, “If it wasn’t a wig, we would have had so much less time to shoot. And we were f—— sprinting.”</p><p id=par-4_69>The blonde wig Stewart wore was perfected by hair designer Wakana Yoshihara, who cut her teeth as a hairstylist in 1990s London by learning the tricky Diana hairdo. According to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood Reporter</a>, Yoshihara honed the wig process over eight months to prepare for filming. Going with the wig instead of Stewart’s actual hair ultimately made the eye-popping 37-day shoot possible amid coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions which further hampered the production.</p><h2 id=h-when-else-has-kristen-stewart-gone-blonde>When else has Kristen Stewart gone blonde?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_72>Kristen Stewart has sported blonde locks before. She had dirty blonde hair when&nbsp;she played Jodie Foster’s daughter&nbsp;in David Fincher’s&nbsp;Panic Room&nbsp;back in 2002. In 2007’s&nbsp;In the Land of Women, Stewart sparked romantic interest from Adam Brody with a blonde look. In recent years, she also went blonde in arthouse flicks&nbsp;JT LeRoy&nbsp;and&nbsp;Seberg. And in the <a href=#>romantic comedy&nbsp;Happiest Season</a>, she played a blonde woman who goes home for the holidays to meet her girlfriend’s family.</p><p id=par-6_70>Stewart hasn’t only been blonde in lower-profile films, however. When the&nbsp;2019 action-thriller&nbsp;Charlie’s Angels&nbsp;trailer debuted, Stewart’s hair attracted attention. As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bustle</a>&nbsp;pointed out, the pixie cut — balancing platinum blonde tips with dark roots — was similar to what she was sporting in real life at the time of filming. Yet it still created plenty of buzz before the film’s release. In other parts of the film, Stewart rocks a full blonde ponytail.</p><h2 id=h-kristen-stewart-s-possible-upcoming-style-adventures>Kristen Stewart’s possible upcoming style adventures</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=en dir=ltr>David Cronenberg's next film is titled Crimes of the Future and it'll concern something he calls "Accelerated Evolution Syndrome."
