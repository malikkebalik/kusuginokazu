But he suffered an injury while he was playing professionally. This post will tell you everything you need to know about what happened to him.</p><h2><strong>When Did Cooper Webb Get Injury?</strong></h2><p><strong>Cooper Webb suffered a concussion in Nashville in April 2023. </strong>A concussion is a kind of traumatic brain injury or TBI, brought on by a blow to the head or a body strike that causes the head and brain to move quickly back and forth.</p><p>After being kept at a nearby hospital for the evening he told his fans all about his health. He said:</p><p>“I am thankful that everything else has checked out okay. This will unfortunately put an end to my SX season. It hurts to have it end like this, but I can hold my head high knowing I gave it my all. Nobody is at fault. I made a small mistake and shit happens in racing. Let’s be better than that.”</p><p>You can read his statement in a post provided below:</p><p><strong>If you want to know which other stars get injured during their career then you can check out our below posts:</strong></p><h2><strong>What Did Cooper Webb Say About His Health?</strong></h2><p>After one month of injury,&nbsp;Cooper Webb of Red Bull KTM gave a report on his health in May 2023. <strong>He said he has a “moderate” concussion and that his doctors have told him to stay off the bike for six to eight weeks.</strong></p><p>So, Webb says he won’t be racing at the start of the Pro Motocross season. However, he does plan to race in the second half of the National season, before the SuperMotocross title.</p><p>In June 2023, it was revealed that following a practice mishap, Cooper Webb was unable to compete in the RedBud Nationals in Buchanan, Michigan. The group did not specify an injury but said:</p><p>“Red Bull KTM Factory Racing’s Cooper Webb will miss this Saturday’s RedBud MX National, Round 5 of the 2023 AMA Pro Motocross Championship, following a practice crash that left him pretty banged up earlier this week.”</p><p>After that mishap, Cooper Webb and Red Bull KTM have made the decision to part ways. The dissolution will put an end to Webb’s outdoor season. Red Bull KTM team manager Ian Harrison said:</p><p>“On behalf of the team, I would like to thank Cooper for the years of successes we have had together, Over the past five years, we have been on the 450SX podium 52 times and of those, 21 were victories. We won the 450SX titles in 2019 and 2021, had a strong runner-up season in 2020 and finished third this year despite an unfortunate season-ending crash in Nashville.”</p><p>He continued:</p><p>“Cooper had the option in his contract as to whether he wanted to race outdoors and he decided at Daytona that he would not compete in AMA Pro Motocross in 2023. Both Cooper and the team have decided to part ways, this will give him time to recover and then move on to the next chapter of his racing career. The team and myself wish him all the best.”</p><p>Webb said in an Instagram post, “Forever grateful for the opportunity that Roger, Ian and the entire team gave me.”</p><p>We hope that Cooper Webb will get well soon.
